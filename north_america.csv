1,post,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:10:06 UTC,5,"Advice for Chicago -&gt; Detroit -&gt; Cleveland -&gt; Pittsburgh itinerary My wife and I are in the beginning stages of planning a trip next spring to Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh  We’re flying into Chicago which will be our second time visiting and plan to spend 5 nights there before continuing on to Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. We’re thinking of flying from Chicago to Detroit and then taking Amtrak between the other cities  Right now, our rough plan looks like this:  * Chicago - 5 nights * Detroit - 2 nights * Cleveland - 2 nights * Pittsburgh - 3 nights  We’re into urban exploring, museums, architecture, local food, and just walking around interesting neighborhoods. Not really into nightlife or live music. We’ve originally from San Francisco but haven’t done this Midwest route before.  Questions:  * Does this pacing seem reasonable? * Any favorite neighborhoods, scenic routes, or museum tips in these cities? * Worth using Amtrak between Detroit, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, or would flying/renting a car be better? * Any hidden gems or experiences we shouldn’t miss?  Thanks for any suggestions!     EDIT - Wow! Thanks everybody for all the info and suggestions.  We're now thinking of adding on Milwaukee to our trip so might spend 2 nights there after Chicago and then fly to Detroit,  then rent a car for the remainder of our trip."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:13:04 UTC,4,"To answer your last question, a car might be better for the Midwestern portion after Chicago, just cause it would give you extra flexibility on hotels/museums/etc that are outside of city centers. There are also some smaller cities along the way (Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, etc) which are easier to stop at via car than via train just because of the way the Amtrak route network is laid out. Some of these states have expensive toll roads though, so heads up to switch to ""no tolls"" mode on google maps if you want to avoid  When you're in Chicago, local transit is better than driving"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:50:41 UTC,1,"Would it be worthwhile to rent a car and visit Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor and anywhere else along the way from Chicago to Detroit?"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:25:54 UTC,2,"Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids is nice. Maybe The Air Zoo in Kalamazoo if you're into that sort of thing. Ann Arbor is a nice college town with decent art, natural history, and hands-on museums. Detroit has a bigger art museum, The Motown Museum, three major sports stadiums, and a nice riverfront."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:53:25 UTC,2,I recommend Amtrak from Detroit to Chicago unless you want to drive.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 03:33:57 UTC,2,Also check out st Joe and new Buffalo you could make a whole extra trip out of the extra day driving western Michigan
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 03:28:19 UTC,1,I also recommend Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 03:32:41 UTC,1,Detroit is not even that bad of a drive from Chicago you can do it most of the way later one night stay in the middle then arrive by early next day probably better and cheaper than flying
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:40:24 UTC,3,May want to check out Milwaukee too. Seems like it’s a city that would fit your theme very well. Its only around 90 minutes from Chicago and has a really impressive art museum that is famous for its architecture.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:57:19 UTC,1,Thanks - we will look into adding Milwaukee to our trip - how many nights should we spend there?
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:07:20 UTC,3,"Id say one or two nights or just make it a day trip from Chicago. Some things to check out. Pabst Mansion, Art Museum, Harley Davidson Museum, Natural History Museum, County Zoo is actually really nice, the Milwaukee Riverwalk."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 11:23:13 UTC,2,I’d add the Mitchell Dome gardens onto this list.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:24:58 UTC,3,"Chicago museum of art is one of the best art museums outside of Paris (not sure if it still holds that status, but it’s amazing) so I would for sure make time for that."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:35:51 UTC,2,I don’t think Amtrak goes from Detroit to Cleveland.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:44:34 UTC,1,You're right -  so we will need to either rent a car or fly between those cities
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:54:13 UTC,2,There’s also Flexbus. I was trying to rent a car from Chicago and drive to a different city in Ohio. None of the places I called would allow it.   Maybe you’ll have better luck.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:54:49 UTC,2,Yeah bus is quick because Detroit and Cleveland is not worth a flight unless you hate buses
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:56:55 UTC,2,Fun fact I learned about Pittsburgh while I was there. People there are pretty nice. Heard if you want to get them fired up to say CLE has something better than PGH.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 02:29:15 UTC,0,"You will want to rent a car. The drives from these will be shorter than dealing with airports even though the flights will be up and down.  I think Chicago/Detroit is the longest and is maybe 4.5 hours. Then to Cleveland is about 3 or so, and then just about 2 to get to Pittsburgh."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 13:01:46 UTC,1,Thanks - I think we will take the train to Detroit and then rent a car for the rest of the trip
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:46:26 UTC,2,"As a Michigander i might be biased.  But would lop a day off Chicago and add one for the western part of Michigan.  The Lake Michigan coast of Michigan is second to none.     For Detroit I would stay in the city core. This would include downtown, case corridor, midtown, corktown, Woodbridge and a few other neighborhoods.  For museums the DIA is excellent.  Henry ford and greenfield village are two of the best American history museums in the country.  The Motown museum is a place I take every first time visitor as well.  If you’re in town on a Saturday eastern market is a must visit. If I can be of additional assistance just PM me"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 00:55:00 UTC,2,We're committed to 5 nights in Chicago but have some wiggle room to add in a 2-3 more nights here and there
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:27:47 UTC,1,If you like museums The Henry Ford in Dearborn and the associated Greenfield Village are truly world-class.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:19:20 UTC,2,"Cleveland Museum of Art was free and amazing when I lived there. Go for a hike at Cuyahoga Valley National Park.   I've lived in both Pittsburgh and Cleveland, and I just enjoy walking around both downtowns and looking at the skyscrapers."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:59:17 UTC,2,Pittsburgh: Andy Warhol museum
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 04:08:48 UTC,2,"If you like baseball, you should make stops at Wrigley Field in Chicago (the most famous/iconic old ballpark) and PNC Park in Pittsburgh (among the most beautiful parks in the country, with a great view of Pittsburgh's downtown and bridge architecture). Comerica Park in Detroit is also outstanding, and Guardians games in Cleveland are affordable.   In Pittsburgh, the North Shore has the Warhol Museum, the National Aviary, and the Carnegie Science Center. Downtown is super walkable, and you can take the subway in the downtown and North Shore area for free to get around easier.   If you rent a car (or figure out the bus system--I don't know how complicated it is) you can get to the Pitt campus from downtown in about fifteen minutes. (You could probably walk to it in an hour or so.) They have a couple more good Carnegie museums (art and natural history) and a botanical gardens. And you can just explore the neighborhood.   With a short light rail ride and some walking you can explore the South Side, which has great hills and steps (Pittsburgh has a ton of steps) with great views of the city and the mountains/rivers beyond. We did the Church Route, which was quite good, but if you poke around on the South Side Slopes website you can find some other routes that might also be fun: [https://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek/church-route/](https://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek/church-route/) . You should also check out one or both funicular railroads: the Duquesne Incline and the Monongahela Incline, which take you up or down steep slopes in a rail car. You can take them round trip or go up one, wander to the other and come down. Or walk up via various trails and then take the train down. I don't have many real food recommendations, but Primanti Bros (their most famous sandwich) was definitely a good eat, and the original location is maybe a twenty minute walk from downtown and is near an entertainment mall district with some fun activities, and there is some other interesting food stuff in the same area.    I've only been to Detroit once, and for less than a day to see a Tigers game at Comerica. But they've got free public transit with the people mover (an elevated loop) and the QLine (a street level light rail) that connects the riverfront to the Wayne State Campus. Downtown Detroit is very cool, with some interesting old architecture and some newer stuff like the Ren Center, as well as a great walk along the riverfront. We also took the ten minute drive to the original Buddy's Pizza, where Detroit style pizza originated, and it was definitely worth the trip. (There is also a Buddy's downtown, but the atmosphere isn't quite the same--not sure about the food.)   Cleveland I can't really speak to, as I haven't given it a proper visit. But I enjoyed my trip to Progressive Field, where the Guardians play, and it was fun strolling around the area around the park.   Chicago has really too much for me to wrap my mind around right now for a post. The Art Institute is a must see, though. If you like architecture, look into one of the architecture boat tours that they offer. Going to the top of the Hancock (or whatever they call it now) and the Sears Tower (or whatever they call it now) is worth it. And the food ... alas, I don't even know where to start. But Italian Beef, probably at Al's #1. Not a bad place to start."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 13:06:50 UTC,1,Thanks! We went to Wrigley the last time we were in Chicago. We're originally from San Francisco and are hoping to schedule this trip to coincide with a Giants game in at least one of the cities we plan to visit
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 21:20:44 UTC,1,"The Duquesne Incline is so much fun! The view from the top is wonderful.  You might not be able to fit this in, but the Frank Lloyd Wright designed house, Falling Water, is an hour from Pittsburgh by car and is amazing."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:39:56 UTC,1,"You could train from Chicago to Milwaukee, ride the Lake Express to Muskegon, MI. Rent a car there and drive to Detroit. I would drive along the Lake Michigan shore to Holland or Traverse City before heading south. It’s truly beautiful. Some of the best beaches in the country are along Lake Michigan."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:49:01 UTC,1,"Take a gander at Spartan Armor for body armor,  Springfield armory for personal defense POM defense spray"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:50:29 UTC,1,"You can take Amtrak from Chicago to Detroit but you need to take a bus from Detroit to Toledo the train or bus to Cleveland.  A bus from Cleveland to Detroit or Pittsburgh is not long though if you don’t want to fly.  In Detroit see eastern market, DNR discovery center, waterfront, Belle isle aquarium, conservatory, Detroit Historical Museum, Woodbridge pub, Detroit Institute of Art, ride the people move for site seeing, walk around the RenCen, Motown Museum walk through greektown, tigers game, ride the streetcar up Woodward, go to Hamtramck polish village cafe, Bucharest schwarma is good, look at campus martius park, take a picture of the Ambassador Bridge.  If you were there longer you could visit Canada on other side of river and Henry ford greenfield village museums in Dearborn. I recommend renting a bike and a bike tour or a boat tour as well.  Have Fun!"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:54:44 UTC,1,"I used to live in Cleveland Ohio area, and I would recommend renting a car for at least the day you drive from Detroit and keep it until you leave Pittsburgh. In my experience, Cleveland is very car friendly (and relatively car dependent). If you’re into sports, Cleveland Guardians tickets are pretty cheap and in a really cool part of the city (Gateway District &amp; East Fourth Street). Playhouse Square Broadway Theatre is also amazing! Also recommend checking out the Lake View Cemetery (and Garfield Monument), Little Italy, and Cleveland Museum of Natural History (all pretty close to each other too."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 13:29:13 UTC,1,Thanks - we will rent a car since there isn't direct rail service from Detroit to Cleveland and I'm not keen on taking Greyhound. We're originally from San Francisco and are hoping to schedule this trip to coincide with a Giants game in at least one of the cities we plan to visit
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 01:55:06 UTC,1,I got something called a Go City pass in Boston. The unlimited one lets you book from a sizable list of attractions/tickets/tours. Was a fantastic deal considering the cost of the included tickets and tours. I haven’t done it for Chicago but I’d recommend checking it out! (Warning that you can only book 1 tour per day)
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 02:00:10 UTC,1,I’d add 2 nights in Milwaukee too
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 02:11:44 UTC,1,"If you end up with a car when you visit Cleveland but are still interested in trains, be sure to drive down to Rockside Road and take a ride on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad! You could make a day trip to Akron and especially peninsula (in the heart of the national park) out of it and take the train back north!"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 02:55:17 UTC,1,"Definitely rent a car!! You can enjoy a lot of cool things in between the cities this way.  Be sure to check out the art museum in Cleveland (it is world famous), cuyahoga valley national park, watch the sunset/sunrise over Lake Erie from any of our lovely beaches and lake parks. Eat at Cordelia, Pier W for fancy seafood dinner with a view (make a reservation), west side market for lunch or snacks. If you like history, go to the lake view cemetery and do the free quickie tours of the Garfield monument and the Wade chapel. It’s actually an official arboretum. Really incredible grounds. There are many Rockefellers buried there. I know this sounds like a wild suggestion but it’s a really cool place to spend an hour or two and take a nice walk (you can of course drive around and pull off when you want to look at something) The people who do the history tours there are very interesting. It’s also right next to little Italy which is cute and worth a stop too."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 07:25:14 UTC,1,"The Cleveland-&gt;Pittsburgh Amtrak is 2-5am or something like that, which makes for a miserable time. You *could* take Greyhound, but I'm not sure what the station situation is in Cleveland these days. As others have said, renting a car is unfortunately probably best if you can.  Of those 4 cities, Pittsburgh is second only to Chicago for walkability. Mattress Factory is another museum worth visiting (it's all contemporary art installations), in an interesting part of town. There are a ton of old Catholic churches (https://pghshrines.org/) if that's your thing. Strip District is a must for food and walking (go before 3pm though, since wholesalers shut down early). You could potentially walk Strip District -&gt; Lawrenceville -&gt; Bloomfield -&gt; E Liberty -&gt; Shadyside -&gt; Squirrel Hill -&gt; Oakland, it's safe and pleasant most of the way although you'll face some steep hills.  Pittsburgh's most unique food is generally Eastern European. There are a lot of great pierogi spots, but they tend to be in working-class areas outside the city center. I recommend Polska Laska, Forgotten Taste, Pierogies Plus. Closer into the walkable city: for fancy vegan Polish, go to Apteka. For bagels, go to Pigeon (take-out only). (Though to be fair, all 4 cities on your list are gonna have a lot of Polish food.)  The new trendy restaurant is Fet-Fisk, which is modern fancy Swedish. There's also some very good Chinese food (especially Sichuan) in Squirrel Hill and Oakland, but if you're in SF you don't need to do that."

,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 19:56:18 UTC,1,Skip Cleveland. Just don’t bother. Detroit to Pittsburgh in a day is easy.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 00:27:45 UTC,1,Watch baseball games in those stadiums.  Pitt is probably the best there is
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 00:29:05 UTC,1,For sure! We're originally from San Francisco and are hoping to schedule this trip to coincide with a Giants game in at least one of the cities we plan to visit
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 00:29:41 UTC,1,"If you end up driving from Chicago  to  Detroit,  then not long after you get out of IL, is the Indiana Dunes National  Park.  That place is amazing. Spend a day on the beach or hike the trails."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 06:15:10 UTC,1,"I’m planning that same itinerary for a trip this fall.  The Amtrak arrives in Cleveland in the middle of the night, so that’s a no-go.  Renting a car would mean paying for parking at most of the hotels and change the nature of the trip.  These cities have walkable downtowns and have decent public transit.  We decided to fly into Chicago, Amtrak to Detroit, then bus to Cleveland and Pittsburgh."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 11:13:52 UTC,1,I’d be interested in hearing about your trip - can you post a trip report afterwards?
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 11:21:44 UTC,1,The Museum of Science and Industry and the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago are both world class museums that I would not miss if I were you. MSI has a genuine German UBoat you can tour that they built an entire wing of the museum around. I cannot recommend that museum enough.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 13:27:54 UTC,1,"Chicago to Detroit by train is good, it's the Amtrak Wolverine which runs multiple times per day and goes 110mph through Michigan. Not the most scenic route but you will see corn fields, industry, and the downtown of a few Michigan cities. As a tourist in Detroit you can get around surprisingly well with public transit, as the light rail line and people mover go to the neighborhoods and attractions you'd want to visit, with the exception of the Henry Ford museum. Since you like architecture make sure to look up lists of Detroit buildings to see - there are some incredible lobbies and architectural details (don't miss the lobby of the Guardian building). Selden Standard and Boabab Fare are my restaurant recommendations, both on the light rail line.  Leaving Detroit you'll just have to make a transportation decision, I think rental car is probably the best bet for getting to and around Cleveland and Pittsburgh, but it's possible by bus and then uber/lyft."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 13:50:21 UTC,1,"I would never rely on Amtrak for this. It is notorious for delays. You cannot rely on anything.   Get a car and get an iPass for tolls. Yourself, not through the rental car company."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 14:42:28 UTC,1,"There’s a train that runs from Chicago to Detroit, no reason to fly. There is not a train that runs from Detroit to Cleveland, but a mix of bus/train (unreliable and takes longer than driving). Just one day for Detroit and Cleveland is kinda lame. Cut one of them out and give the days to the one that remains."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 20:41:14 UTC,1,"Rent a car. Except for Chicago, there isn't enough central city or public transit to enjoy the kinds of things you'll want to explore in the 3 other cites, except may P'burgh. So many more interesting things just out of reach, and more exemplary of the Midwest / Great Lakes experience"
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 23:13:25 UTC,1,"Cleveland’s West Side Market is not to be missed—ethnic foods, local culture, and beaux arts architecture. The Ohio City neighborhood has beautiful Victorian homes and is nice to walk around.   Cleveland Museum of Art is world class and free. It’s accessible by rapid transit if you’re staying near the Terminal Tower downtown.   Cleveland’s theatre district is the second biggest in the country (second only to Broadway in NYC)."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-27 03:19:27 UTC,1,"NY transplant living in Pittsburgh for the last 20+ years. Happy to share anything pertaining to my city, particularly food and drink. We have an Airbnb in the East End if you are looking for a quiet stay. I highly recommend having a rental car for all of those cities except Chicago.. it will make life so much easier and maximize your time and money spent. Great to see most of your days spent in Chicago, it's one of our favorite cities in the country. The food, I'm sure as you know, is amazing. So much history, impressive architecture, and art in all of these cities.  Detroit's revival in the last 10-15 years is mind-blowingly impressive, particularly the folks that you'll meet there and everything that they have been through and worked towards their reconstruction. The Eastern market is great and the food scene is really amazing, particularly the variety of cuisine available.  I'll get gup, but if you don't mind adding some commuting hours, I might skip Cleveland and work in Toronto, Milwaukee, and/or Madison in the itinerary instead. If Cleveland is the move, the lake will be hopefully lovely while you're there and the West Side Market is nice.   Enjoy your holiday!"

,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-26 11:36:05 UTC,0,I would definitely rent a car instead of relying on train.   Pittsburgh is awesome but 3 nights might be a bit much. You have to go to Mount Washington and ride the incline. Also check out cathedral of learning. It's the tallest academic building in the world.
,comment,USA,Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh; San Francisco,2025-07-25 02:33:06 UTC,-1,"my advice would be to skip Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh portion.  Go Chicago, Wisconsin, to UP &amp; call it a day"

This is prob going to happen a year from now, so it would be Summer. We are thinking of visiting New England, maybe Boston. We want to go for some spooky or gloomy vibes. In this senario we are also thinking about visiting Vermont. I know we can't do both as we can't stay on both places and they are pretty far away. Another thought was maybe to visit the Appalachia mountains, maybe stay in West Virginia, but after research the countryside seems kind of hostile (people and nature wise), so maybe it's gonna be kind of dangerous for us. (i don't mean to offend anyone, my country is also very poor and not every area is nice). We are set to visit the East coast. I would appreciate any feedback on this, except New York bc i don't think we have the budget for it rn! Thank you!"

While Halloween is typically a neighborhood/local holiday for Americans, you can have some fun in Salem.  West Virginia is a beautiful state with a lot of parkland for camping, ""glamping"" and even some pretty major nature resorts. But you'll almost certainly need a car for this, and driving in the mountains is not for everyone."
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 21:01:17 UTC,2,"West Virginia is super beautiful but you have to download a lot of maps offline as you lose cell service frequently.  A lot of West Virginia has a weird vertical monopoly of an area. So a site like Seneca rocks has a major place to camp/get a cabin in, they run the general store and the only restaurant within a 15 minute drive and Wi-Fi as you lose cell service and will be looking for it. Then if you don't like them you go elsewhere and you can find the exact same thing again. Same stuff for sale and same food for the most part.  Also yeah almost definitely need a car unless there is a new river gorge bus from like DC"

Oh, I don't mean you'll be mugged or anything. But it is absolutely packed, most of the roads are overwhelmed with traffic, and if you have a medical emergency, like you break your arm or something, the ambulance will get to you as quickly as they can… which could be an hour due to local congestion. An hour is a painfully long time to wait with a broken arm.  However, there are all kinds of spooky spots and the U.S. on Halloween can be tons of fun.

There's no doubt it's gotten out of hand recently though, and more regulations are warranted, but all the money that gets spent in October keeps a lot of businesses going, so it's tough to balance their interests with those of residents who can't get to the grocery store."

Portland, Maine is nice, and New Hampshire has mountains and lakes that may satisfy the Vermont feeling. September is when it begins autumn here, which is our spooky season.

,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 18:20:16 UTC,3,"WV native speaking here so I'm a bit biased, but WV has a lot of spooky places to visit if that's your thing (Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, West Virginia Penitentiary, Mothman Museum at Point Pleasant, etc.). If you catch the right weather, some mornings can see fog settling over the mountains and it can make things seem a bit spooky if you aren't used to it. Some roads, especially in the summer when the mountains are full green, can seem like portals to another world, and just seem to twist and turn with the mountains, trees on both sides. If you catch the mountains during the fall months, everything explodes in color though, and the mountains kinda turn rainbow (mostly yellows, oranges, reds and purples).  The state has been hit hard by a lot of things (including drugs), but it actually has a violent crime rate that's like 27% lower then the national average. For perspective, that puts it in the top 10 of all states for public safety (one of the few things WV doesn't do badly in). It's pretty safe, and people aren't really hostile. Just don't bring up politics and you'll be fine, but that's also the same for the rest of the US as well no matter where you go.  The nature side is pretty peaceful. There's a lot of deer, rabbits, foxes, and very pretty landscapes and places to hike and go camping and generally do outdoor activities (like white water rafting on the New River) and plenty of public parks you can visit for free. There are bears, but you're unlikely to see them unless you actively go looking and know how to find them.  If you're planning a trip to the US east coast regardless of where you to decide to go, make sure you set aside a good amount of money for traveling (like gas and a decent car rental), along with money for hotels, etc. You'll be driving a lot (especially if you decide visit WV)."
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 19:13:56 UTC,1,I always like to point out that the New River is one of the oldest rivers on the planet. The Appalachians started out looking like the Rockies but have been worn down over time. The New River has been carving all that time.

As for the wildlife being hostile in Appalachia, can I assume you're worried about bears? Those are all over New England as well but tend to leave people alone.

I can sometimes hear the voices of[ my parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHuynlD_ckM).  But seriously, most of our stories of ghosts in the forests are because of foxes. Their cries can range from sounding like a woman screaming to a child crying. Foxes can be pretty stealthy so by the time you get outside to investigate in the middle of the night, they've already disappeared.   The thing you need to be worried about is leaving the trail while hiking. The forests can be incredibly dense and stories do pop up of people who died only a mile from the trail because they got lost and couldn't find their way back."

The other two were overly focused on the gilded white families who lived there.

Yes - Salem has some very interesting historic streets, and there is a certain tang to the place if you know about the witch trials and abhorrent executions that occurred - but the main street tat was gagging.

Summer's there are great for the food, typical New England vibe, and Acadia national park is lovely. As people have said Salem, MA is the center of New England spooky, but if you come in October it will be wall to wall tourists.  Salem has the same spooky vibe, same tours, and sites in September but with a fraction of the people (if you do come in October 2026 book EARLY, like by the end of this year). For spooky I would look at ghost tours in the cities you go to, they are touristy but fun to hear all the stories.

Boston is a great starting point, lots to see and do and very walkable with serviceable subway and public transit.  Vermont is only about 2 1/2 hour drive from Boston, and there’s plenty of that spooky vibe, but less so in summer.  Otherwise it’s incredibly beautiful here in Vermont, and easy access to spectacular natural settings and recreation."
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 18:58:01 UTC,1,"When planning where to go, take into account the fact that the US is bigger than most Europeans think.  US states are the size of European countries. It will take you a long time to drive around. Scenic but takes time. New England contains most of the tinier states, and remember another commenter mentioned 4 hours to drive from Boston to Vermont."

That said I'm not sure I'd recommend it if you're a newbie to the US purely because there are much more interesting places on the East Coast to go first!"
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 19:08:08 UTC,1,"The Vermont countryside is honestly the most tolerant and socially and politically left countryside in the entire country. You shouldn’t have an issue in rural Vermont. Rural West Virginia, I’d be more careful and pick a richer resort town used to tourists.  Vermont is not that far from Boston, but West Virginia is much farther. Lots of tourists visit Salem…honestly too many for a lot of people’s tastes."

,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 19:51:42 UTC,1,"Salem Massachusetts is spooky. Close to Boston. Massachusetts is very historic and lovely. A good plan is flying to Boston and visit the  Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. There is a documentary about it called"" This is A Robbery."" Wonderful museum.  You can visit places easily like Salem where I actually got a head ache near the park where they hung witches. Rockport MA is an adorable artist colony with lots of shops and restaurants worth a visit for clam chowder. Plymouth MA was where the Pilgrims landed and it's quaint but Plymouth Rock is laughably over rated. Still I like Plymouth. You can head south to Newport RI and see the Vanderbilt mansion and Rose Cliff where the original great Gatsby ( with Robert Redford) was filmed. You can see where JFK and Jackie got married and where her family summer home was. There are more preserved historic homes in Newport than anywhere in the US. Vermont and New Hampshire are worth visiting too but I cant say they are very spooky. I prefer NH because of places like Lake Winnipesaukee and the white Mountains where there is Hotel that looks right out of the movie the Shining. It's the Omni Mt. Washington. I love North Conway NH and you can visit Zeb's General store and try the Alpine Slide, Mountain coaster or head to water slides. As for natural beauty- the ""flume"" at Franconia Notch national park is worth visiting. Beautiful hike. You might see a moose too. All of these places are doable from Boston.  Btw I'm from Maryland and love the Mid-Atlantic area but in summer- new England is fantastic. Better than the Appalachian trail."

In the summer, Salem is just a normal, if charming and historic, seaside New England town that just happens to have a witch museum. You will not feel a gloomy or spooky vibe. It will probably be hot and humid. If you want gloom and spooky vibes, postpone until October.   As others have said, Boston isn’t far from Vermont. Significantly closer to Boston is New Hampshire which has large lakes, New England’s highest peaks, and quaint small towns. You could stay in Boston the whole time and even just do a day trip of it, though I’d recommend splitting your stay between the city and somewhere like North Conway in NH or Stowe in VT."

You can get on the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is so scenic in October that people come from all over the eastern US to drive on it.  If you stay on the Parkway into North Carolina, you can even visit Transylvania County!"
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 20:43:00 UTC,1,Boston is close to Salem so if you are looking for spooky vibes make sure you visit Salem.  Vermont is pretty close to Boston so I would do those two definitely.  West Virginia is quite a ways from Boston and Vermont. I’d leave that for another trip.  Hope you enjoy!
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-18 20:52:42 UTC,1,"Boston and Vermont are 3-4 hrs apart depending on where you’re going but you’ll need to rent a car. If you’re going to go visit West Virginia for the sake of seeing nature, you really ought at that point to just fly the extra few hours and go to one of the national parks in the western states like the Grand Canyon or Zion.  I’m sure West Virginia is pretty but it doesn’t have anything that you couldn’t see in say Bavaria, and what’s really mind blowing about the U.S. nature wise are its western national parks. Places like the Grand Canyon, Zion, and Yosemite really are unique and absolutely amazing. I live out west now but I used to live in DC and NYC, and there are very few places in eastern states that have anywhere near the same level of natural beauty as out west.  IMO traveling to the U.S. for the first time just to see West Virginia would be a waste. I’m not sure exactly what the equivalent would be but it would be something like an American visiting Europe for the very first time and deciding to go to Manchester, or Thessaloniki, or Frankfurt, or Wroclaw. Like those are all perfectly fine places but you should see London, Athens, Berlin, and Krakow before any of those cities"

Have fun!!"
,comment,USA,Boston; New York,2025-07-19 14:11:28 UTC,1,"Smart decision.   The west coast is a much bigger scale. At our age, we can only tolerate a couple of weeks of road trip, but you might do longer. For us, I consider Northern California, Southern California, Four Corners region, and the remaining Utah National Parks to be four separate trips, with the Grand Canyon included with either the Utah parks or the Four Corners region. (Four Corners includes the parks and attractions around northeast Arizona, southeast Utah, southwest Colorado, and northwest New Mexico, with Monument Valley and Mesa Verde National Park probably the two most significant places in the region).   If you had a month, you could possibly reduce this down to two separate trips. Some people would try to squeeze it down to all in one trip, but they’s have to give up some of the places."

Also Boston and Vermont are both quite doable in the same trip. Will you have a car? Boston to Burlington, in Northern Vermont, is 3.5 hours.  For spooky and gloomy, you want winter.

There’s a witch museum, tours of the House of the Seven Gables, a pirate museum, old cemetery tour and haunted tours at night. Short drive north is Gloucester, Massachusetts. Tour the Hammond Castle, eat lobster, go on a whale watch tour boat. Stay at the Cape Ann Motor Inn overlooking the ocean. Then we drove south 2 hours to Newport, Rhode Island to tour the Gilded Age mansions there. You should be able to Google all this and find more in the area."

Lots of history and is just a cool town with lots of great food and stuff to see and you can take the train out of town (tho no where as awesome as the European trains but still) and they have a good in town metro system plus it is easy walking around. They also have a good free “redline” walking tour where you basically just follow the redline to various historical points. Plus there’s lots of cheaper direct flights there from Europe.

I wouldn't recommend Salem as it's a cheesy tourist trap. If you want a cool scenic coastal town there are better options.  I'd do I-93 and tour the White Mountains. If it's in the fall, so much the better. Lots of scenic covered bridges in NH, and cute little towns.  One caveat if you like hiking: beware the White Mountain summits. Trails are extremely steep and rocky and the weather can be ferocious. Lots of shorter, lower hikes that don't expose you to danger but if you wanted to hike up Lafayette or the Presidentals, be prepared."

Country superstar Dolly Parton owns many shops and they're nice; she also opened Dollywood, which is the mountain answer to the Magic Kingdom.   There are attractions in Pigeon Forge such as skydiving.   Trolleys take visitors anywhere they want and they even make connections to Gatlinburg.   Gatlinburg Tennessee is a small town but it's full of charm. There are museums, the Aquarium of the Smokies, and just as much of a variety of restaurants and shopping as you'll find in Pigeon Forge. It also has a Space Needle similar to that in Seattle.   A four lane mountain road connects the two. Ride the trolley between the two towns and you can see the mountains without worrying about driving.   In the autumn, through February I believe, the two are decorated throughout with Christmas light displays. In the spring, Dollywood has flower shows. Speaking of shows, Dollywood also has Broadway style productions.   There's a Walgreens in Gatlinburg. There's a Walmart and a Kroger in Pigeon Forge. It's civilized.

,comment,USA,Australia; Boston; Denver; Four Corners; Monterey; Philadelphia; Salem; Santa Rosa; Zion,2025-06-28 11:59:45 UTC,2,"My stock reply for this type of question is to use the northeast corridor for cities (Boston to DC) and the Rockies to west coast for national parks.   The reason for the northeast corridor is that it's the one place in the US where it makes perfect sense to use the train (Amtrak) to go from city to city and public transit within those cities. There's a lot of history, art, architecture, and sports along the way. If you want to get out of the cities a bit, commuter rail from Boston can get you to the Minutemen National Historical Park, to Salem with its witch history, or to one of our New England quaint coastal towns. Gettysburg is an easy drive from Philadelphia or DC.   For the National Parks, one could spend months driving around the west. I think of it as four areas but there are other ways to break it up. There's California, the Pacific northwest, the desert southwest, and the northern rockies.   Our last roadtrip was north-central California with five National Parks: Pinnacles, Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Yosemite, and Redwoods, with additional overnights in Monterey, Santa Rosa (visit the Charles Schulz museum), and Mendocino.   The year before, we did the Four Corners area, with Horseshoe Bend, Petrified Forest (which includes the Painted Desert), Canyon de Chelly, Monument Valley, Mesa Verde, the Taos Pueblo, Arches and Canyonlands. The last two were via a tourist train from Denver, which was a beautiful trip but pricy. We had seen the Grand Canyon, Zion, and Bryce Canyon on a previous trip, but those could have been included in this trip.   We're still planning on the Pacific Northwest and then maybe the northern rockies or Canadian Rockies.   Since you're coming from Australia, I wouldn't rule out Hawaii. Not for the beaches (you have those) but for the indigenous history and culture, the rain forests, active volcanoes, and, if interested, the agriculture (coffee, pineapples, cacao, vanilla, etc.).  Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is still my favorite National Park."

,comment,USA,Chicago; Oregon; Seattle,2025-06-29 16:59:52 UTC,1,Makes more sense to fly to different regions such as NE for a couple weeks then fly from NYC to Chicago - don’t  need a car in Chicago but after city time rent a car to spend a few days on Lake MI. Then back to Chicago or other city fly to LA or Seattle or whatever is close to where they want to go west coast. I think they wanted to see the country. I’ve lived on both coasts and Chicago is in my top five cities in US for tourist vacation. Plus I went to Lake MI for the first time a couple years ago and was so impressed. Have lived in SF bay area and Oregon and it rivals them. Good mix of city (chicago) then a few days of R&amp;R and impressive nature on Lake MI. I think Aussies get much more vacation time than usa and take advantage of spending a lot of time in one place. but just my opinion.

How many people are you talking when you say you and your friends?    What do you like to do?  Are you wanting to include the Midwest and Central states at all or just hit the coasts?  Fine with large cities?  Do you like learning about the history/culture like going to art galleries and museums?  Or are you more into nature like state/national parks, aquariums, etc.?  Mountains or beeches?  Do you want to go to any sporting events?  Concerts?  Plays?  Comedy shows?    Being from Australia, you could hit Hawaii first, then maybe fly into SD and go north on US 1 hitting LA, SF and up through OR and WA.  I’ve never been to Hawaii or LA but been to SD and SF and through that area.  Lots to see in Redwoods/Sequoias, Muir Woods, Yosemite,   Amtrak has a few trains that go through multiple national parks.  You could get a private car and that might be a cool way to knock some of that out.  I looked into it years ago but never did it.  You might be able to start in Seattle ending in DC, then from there head north up the east coast.  Could have that wrong, know they have packages starting in DC though heading the opposite direction.    On the east coast definitely recommend hitting Boston, NY, Philadelphia and DC.  Again could hit all on the train and I personally don’t recommend having a car in any of those cities anyway.  If you started in DC, further north could get a car for New England perhaps all the way up to Acadia.  If you started in Boston ending in DC, could get a car then go through Richmond, Charleston, Atlanta, New Orleans, Florida (if you want to)."

,comment,USA,Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Denver; Las Vegas; Seattle; Vancouver; Washington,2025-06-28 12:15:11 UTC,1,"I’ve seen a lot of good ideas on here and from an efficiency perspective I’d do one of two things. As much as there are cool parts of the middle US it’s so big I probably wouldn’t want to spend days just driving on an uninteresting interstate highway.    As a strategy I would consider either focusing on one of the coasts and maybe inland to a degree.  E.g., west coast from LA up to Seattle or vice versa (or even a stop into Vancouver) and consider going west at some point, too.    Given you have a good bit of time, I might consider doing it in two legs.  E.g., do a leg like I described above such as west coast and maybe work your way as far as the Rocky Mountains.  Then fly to some place on the east coast and do a second leg of the trip such as flying to either Maine and working your way down, or South Caroline and heading north.    Also - if you are not aware, the US airline system mostly runs on a hub and spoke system. Flying between the major hubs tends to be cheaper and faster.  For example, if you started on the west coast some major airports are LAX and Seattle.  Also it wouldn’t be hard (within the US) to fly to or from Las Vegas.  Even places like Denver are an option if you wanted to drive that far off the coast.  East coast major airports are NYC, Washington DC, and Boston.  Atlanta also works and you could head up through the Smoky and Blue Ridge mountains to drive north.    One other consideration, would be if you did fly between major legs of the trip, it would be pretty easy to do a 1 or 2 day layover in Chicago (beautiful city) as O’Hare is a major hub for a few airlines."

If you did that over two weeks, you then hop a flight to Boston and then visit there, down to NYC, Philly, Baltimore, and DC.  Pick specific things to visit going up the West Coast.  That's a long drive.  The only other thing would be if you can land in San Diego and drive up from there because San Diego is arguably the most beautiful city on the West Coast."
,comment,USA,Santa Barbara,2025-06-29 23:06:10 UTC,1,I like this. But I would add cambria after Santa Barbara. Also Carmel and Yosemite. And then Humboldt for the marshes and redwoods.
,comment,USA,,2025-06-28 12:38:50 UTC,1,"Heat is not the only problem, as humidity is the other big issue along most of the east coast and the southeast.  April and May are absolutely wonderful weather wise in most of the US.  Where you go depends on your interests.  There are too many places to see and it's difficult to recommend places without knowing your preferences."
,comment,USA,Los Angeles,2025-06-28 12:58:41 UTC,1,"Look a little more specifically at the area and what you want to do.   If you want national parks, a road trip from Seattle down to Los Angeles would be terrific."

,comment,USA,Bay; Boulder; Colorado; Golden Gate; Jackson; Montana; Monterey; Oregon; Pacifica; Redwood; San Diego; Santa Cruz; Seattle; Vancouver; Wyoming; Zion,2025-06-28 14:30:49 UTC,1,"I would advise a Western trip. Start in San Diego, maybe see national parks up and down California (Death Valley, Yosemite, Giants Sequoia, Redwood) and you can dip into Arizona (Grand Canyon) and Utah (Bryce Canyon or Zion). But don't miss coastal California driving up from LA to SF. Big Sur, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Half Moon Bay, Pacifica, etc. SF and LA have tons to see.   After SF you could head north and hit all the volcanoes. Shasta, Crater Lake, 3 Sisters, MT Hood, Mt St Helen's, Mt Rainier, Northern Cascades, this ends in Seattle. You could dip into Vancouver.   Sounds like you have a lot of time so coastal Oregon is also beautiful. Or you could head east and see some Idaho )Ceour d Alene) Montana (Glacier NP beware of grizzly bears), Wyoming (Yellowstone/Jackson/Tetons more bears) and see some Colorado (Rocky Mountain NP, Boulder, Telluride, Red Rocks, Mesa Verde), back into Utah (Arches/Canyonlands) and Arizona (Navajo reservation and Monument Valley, Sedona), back into California ( Joshua Tree) and back to where you started.   Great fun a ton of awesome hikes. Highlights I would say:  Mount St Helens Yosemite Crater Lake Glacier NP driving to the sun road Grand Canyon Gigantic Trees either at Sequoia NP, Redwood NP, or Muir Woods just north of SF Coastal California, i.e. Route 1   LA and SF have plenty to do and see themselves Griffith Park, The Wedge, Golden Gate Park, Alcatraz, etc.) and I have left out a ton of great stops in between.  Pick and choose according to your schedule. One thing to note is some of these parks don't really open until the snow clears off roads and avalanches are less likely, like Glacier is typically late June. And some of the National Parks you have to get tickets to drive there online well in advance. So be aware of that. If you don't get a driving pass they still have shuttles that will take you to/from the major trailheads but you are then on their schedule"
,comment,USA,Phoenix; Salt Lake; San Diego; Zion,2025-06-28 14:36:24 UTC,1,"A very common itinerary could knock out a good portion of the country and would be something like this: LA &gt; Joshua Tree NP &gt; Vegas &gt; Zion NP &gt; Bryce Canyon NP &gt; Salt Lake City &gt; Arches NP &gt; Canyonlands NP &gt; Grand Canyon NP &gt; Phoenix &gt; Saguaro NP &gt; San Diego &gt; LA  There are LOTS of small additions to you could make along this route as well like Sedona, Death Valley, Horseshoe Canyon, Monument Valley, etc."

There are 9 national parks there or something.  Then drive to Las Vegas for two nights to check it out and then go to Arizona to look at the grand canyon.  From there drive to Utah and see all the national parks, followed by Colorado.  You could spend a lot of time in Utah and Colorado.  Towards the end of your trip closer to July, drive north to Yellowstone in Wyoming.  North of there is glacier national park but it’s hit or miss if it’s open in June because of snow.  Be sure to visit Washington and Oregon in June or July so it is dry and sunny.  Those states are amazing but are better in summer.  I’d fly in and out of the San Francisco or San Jose airport."

,comment,USA,,2025-06-28 17:28:49 UTC,1,"Definitely plan ahead for the national parks if you have any intention of staying in the parks. You need to log on for reservations as soon as they open up, typically around 6 months prior to your stay. Check the National parks websites for details. There are so many wonderful places to visit it’s difficult to narrow down. Yosemite, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon are probably the most obvious places but honestly all of the National parks are worth a visit. If I started listing them I wouldn’t stop."

,comment,USA,Montana; Oregon; San Francisco; Wyoming; Zion,2025-06-28 23:04:46 UTC,1,"We've done road trips into all 48 lower states (from the UK). We just pick an airport, book a car and set off. We have a rough plan of where we're going, but the first couple of trips we booked absolutely nothing in advance other than the first and last nights, because America is geared up for travellers and there are loads of hotels. Now though, we tend to plan a basic route each evening and book a hotel for the next night - you get better prices than just showing up at their door. The only exception would be if you're visiting a really popular location like Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, where you could end up unlucky and find nothing available. We stay off the interstates &amp; freeways, avoid the big cities and stick to small-town America. We actually bought a book of maps that shows all the scenic roads in the USA, and we try to travel as many of them as possible. We usually restrict ourselves to around 300 miles a day.  I think our favourite trip was when we flew to San Francisco then did a big loop through northern California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada &amp; back to San Francisco, mostly on scenic byways. This included Craters of the Moon, Yellowstone, Flaming Gorge, Dinosaur Monument, Grand Staircase, Bryce Canyon, Zion &amp; The Extraterrestrial Highway. So much spectacular landscape, and often so few people sharing it with you."
,comment,USA,Napa; San Diego; San Francisco; United States,2025-06-28 23:21:21 UTC,1,"This is an easy one:  California.  It is by far the best state.  There is a strong argument that California has the best natural scenery (e.g., the entire Pacific coast, Yosemite, Death Valley, etc. etc.) in the United States.  California has what is widely regarded as America’s most attractive city (San Francisco).  California has America’s most famous wine regions (Napa, Sonoma, etc.), which have also become gastronomic regions.  California has LA, which is the entertainment center of the world.  The original Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo, Monterey Aquarium, I could go on and on.  Not to mention Silicon Valley is the tech capital of the world."

Here's a couple ideas (especially for such a long time)  New England: New York, Massachusetts, dip down to Virginia and Maryland. this is the city/urban option with minimal driving as the northeast has the best train coverage. NYC (theatre, culture, nightlife) Boston(history, culture) and DC (museums, national landmarks) are all in this area. If you want nature you can dip down into Virginia (or even further south into Appalachia) or head up to Maine (and have lobster! Yum!). Pennsylvania also has Amish communities to visit. Be sure to try the Shoofly Pie!  Pacific Northwest: Oregon, Northern California, Washington Montana, and Wyoming. National Parks galore and tonnnnnns of beautiful drives. Yellowstone, Redwoods, Mt Rainier, Mt St Helens, Glacier. Plus some great city stuff... Seattle and Portland especially. You could also swing way south and hit the American Desert... Arizona and New Mexico are both beautiful."

Antelope Canyon in Navajo nation is beautiful but you have to book ahead. Canyon de Chelly in Navajo Nation as well. Obviously the Grand Canyon and Mogollon Rim. Would not visit in July though, I’d visit in April. Saguaro national park is cool if you’re into unique flora. If you’re a landscape person, I would totally look into state parks across the country though, they are often underrated and far less crowded than the national parks.  If you’re a city person, top cities to visit imo would be NYC, LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, New Orleans, Austin, Boston, Miami, Las Vegas."

Depending on what time you have I would suggest a western tour. Highlights for nature should be: Yellowstone (#1 most beautiful place in this country imo), Yosemite, Grand Canyon, and Joshua tree (great desert) - though maybe from Australia you’d rather do more forest.   Were I you, I would fly to Los Angeles, rent a car - either do a week in LA at beginning or end. Drive to Joshua Tree or straight to Grand Canyon, then up to Zion/Arches in Utah, then to Yellowstone, then either back down to Yosemite or Portland and then down the coast to California and San Francisco. If going straight to Yosemite, then go to San Francisco, spend a week and then drive down to coast to LA. This is a good balance of great cities and astounding nature."

Still, it was way better than Grand Junction which was an absolute slum."
,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-21 11:40:31 UTC,3,"Rocky Mtn Nat Pk is really nice, and nearby Estes Park is your classic “adjacent tourist town” with that hotel from “The Shining” close by. The elk rut in the park is amazing to see, if that is happening when you’re there.   Colorado National Pk near Grand Junction has striking red rock cliffs (like Utah parks), nearby Fruita is an interesting town with the whole Mike the Headless Chicken festival/story.  As mentioned, Durango/Silverton area is also nice; Black Canyon of the Gunnison is an incredible sight but not really much else out there, maybe Montrose?; Also, Nederland was a trippy town (in every sense) but I think they stopped doing Dead Guy Days, not sure."

We started in Denver did Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak in the morning and then drove to Durango and stopped at the Great Sand Dunes.  It’s a long day of travel but a beautiful drive.  In Durango we visited Mesa Verde, did a few hikes and visited Silverton. We stayed a few days in Durango. We rented a jeep in Silverton, put the top down and drove the Alpine Loop, which is awesome.  We also stopped and tried to climb Handies but a storm rolled in.  It missed us, but we did not want to get stuck up there in a storm.  We stopped in Ouray one night and loved it.  Lots of waterfalls.  Finished with a couple nights in Glennwood Springs and did some easy whitewater rafting.    Earlier this summer we did Moab and Breckenridge in a trip.  It was cool and Moab is awesome and endless things to do in Arches and Canyonlands.  We hiked Mt Sherman and Bierstadt when we were in Breck.    Both trips were wonderful."

Make sure you take a ranger guided tour of one of the cliff dwellings. You'll learn so much more than doing it on your own.

,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-25 13:23:34 UTC,1,"A lot of 'climbing' of 14ers is simply a hike. Some require technical climbing, but quite a few or just a hike that is absolutely doable by many people. Of course they need to take a couple of days to get acclimated first, many people don't follow that advice though and still climb a 14er. The other important thing is that if you're doing it in the summertime, you need to start early so that you're below Timberline by around noon, before the afternoon thunderstorms cuz otherwise, you make a mighty nice target for lightning. If you're fit, healthy and have done research and know what you're doing, 'climbing' a 14er is a perfectly reasonable thing to do while you're in Colorado."
,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-25 14:44:26 UTC,1,"On 7 days total, coming from unknown altitude, with pre-teens, no.  Doing a 14er will consume their entire trip and likely leave at least one of them unwell.  And nobody is talking about rock climbing.  It's cute that everyone likes to talk about 14ers and how to do them.  Even parking and walking for a while up part of the trail for Bierstadt would wreck a fit person who has only been here a few days.  If folks actually want to enjoy Colorado on a short trip with kids in tow, that ain't the way.  Better to drive up Mt. Evans (and not linger).  There are lots of opportunities to drive passes or hike even 9 or 10k, get some bikes and do Leadville or some of vail pass from Frisco.  14ers can certainly be done by visitors, but they are not a joke amd require training and physical conditioning."

It all depends on their fitness level &amp; ability to acclimatize.  I've seen many do it without a problem.  Obviously, they need to be aware of their limits &amp; be in tune with their bodies.  But it's by no means unachievable &amp; teens are often more fit than the adults."

,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-23 04:33:08 UTC,1,"As a lifelong Coloradan, I personally think Southwest Colorado is the most 'amazing'. Mountain towns like Telluride, Crested Butte, Pagosa Springs are all great, as well as the small old mining towns of Silverton and Ouray.  Durango is a nice hub you can fly into to visit all of those areas and is pretty cool itself - lots of things to do outdoor wise and has the Durango-Silverton train which is a really cool experience. The SW area has some incredible peaks and will be less crowded/expensive than some of the northern parts.   With that being said, you can have a ton of fun in areas not that far from Denver. Golden is a really cool town, and if you enjoy casinos Blackhawk is a fun time. Of course you have the ski towns like Breckenridge and Vail that are cool to see but pricey. I'd also heavily recommend Estes Park. In my opinion, Estes has the most beautiful view of any town in Colorado, and Rocky Mountain National Park isn't far which can be explored endlessly."

,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-24 18:57:34 UTC,1,"You have received lots of valid suggestions. Providing my input and some other things to consider.  \- Colorado is not huge, but it is not small, especially for 7 days. I would pick a region that sounds best to you and do it well, rather than spending so much time driving.  \- If you want to do a 14er, plan it later in your trip when you have had a chance to adjust to the altitude. But also pay close attention to the weather. If you are going in summer, thunderstorms regularly roll in during the afternoon, and you don't want to be caught at the top when they come in. Best to start very early in the morning, so you can be headed down before that happens.  \- Vail, Aspen, Breckenridge, other ski towns are all beautiful. Will have tons of activities. But will also be a bit more touristy. Up to you if that is a negative or not.  \- Definitely get a hot spring in somewhere. If you do Pagosa Springs, you can also rent inner tubes. Then there is a bus that runs from town up the river just a bit and drops you off. Then you can float down and get off right at the hot springs. Go soak. And then float again when you want.  \- LOTS of excellent breweries all over the state.  \- If you happen to go to Glenwood Springs, definitely look into the Hanging Lake hike. But also I think you have to have special arrangements to hike it now days? Look into that in advance.  \- Sounds like you are more outdoors type. Group of 6. If you want to save some money on lodging and have a unique experience, check out Hipcamp  \- If you do happen to spend time in Denver, you might check out either Meow Wolf or Water World. Both would be a lot of fun for the family (but also not cheap)."
,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-25 00:39:33 UTC,1,"We went in June with age 12, 13, 15 boys, 19 year old boy and 19 year old girl and 4 adults. Everyone had a great time. Agree with Ouray, Durango. You can probably squeeze in one other place if you want like.  We squeezed in Great Sands NP since it was a good place to stop driving from North Texas and I knew the teenage boys would love sledding.  Below is was my plan that I put together. Some stuff was skipped for various reasons but they are still all good options.  You will want to book train, jeep tour and Mesa Verde tours ASAP.   Day 1  - Drive to Alamosa  - Stay in Best western (hotels suck in Alamosa - best of the picks) Day 2  - 8am Head to Great sand dunes NP 	- Sled sand dunes, Ride the creek flow, swim, Visitor center museum 	- Picnic lunch - Go to alligator park on way out of town - Drive to north route to Ouray (through Gunnison and Montrose)- 4 hours  Day 3 Ouray Airbnb - Hike box canyon? other hikes - Swim Springs park pools?  - Mine tour north of town? Day 4 - 9am Jeep tour   - Hike Cascade, hike baby bath and/or go to springs pools Day 5 - Head south by 10 am to Durango - Drive Million Dollar Highway towards Durango - Stop at old mining town - Stop in silverton if not doing train - Purgatory resort - alpine slide, ski lift, coaster, lunch - Other hikes on way - Downtown Durango for dinner and river walk Day 6 Durango Airbnb  - Head to Mesa Verde National Park  - 9:30 Balcony House tour,  - Check out other sites, hikes in park, picnic lunch - 2:30 pm Cliff palace tour - Head back to Durango after 2nd tour and relax  Day 7  - Durango train trip to Silverton Day 8  - Head home"

,comment,USA,Colorado; Most,2025-07-25 13:19:03 UTC,1,"Oh my gosh, too many to count. Rocky Mountain National park, if you go on a gray rainy day, even better you're going to see a lot more animals! It's especially great during elk rutting season which is in the fall. Near Red Rocks, I really like Dinosaur Ridge, it's unfortunately a long a busy road but it's very safe and they have buses or you can get out and walk from one section to the next, but you can see all different kinds of dinosaur tracks right where they were made, on what is now up tilted rocks. That's really cool cuz you can also see like ridges of water, so you can tell that the area used to be underwater, it's really wild! Also a lot of good hiking at Red Rocks.   I enjoy shopping on Boulders Pearl Street Mall and Chautauqua Park is great, I have seen a bear on one of the trails there, not even far from the parking lot but it was late and it was a very quiet day, usually that area is jam-packed.  Also near Denver, I love the drive up to Mount Evans I think they renamed it and I don't know what they call it now but if you search Mount Evans you'll find it, it's a much better drive than the Pikes Peak drive. You almost always see mountain goats whereas I've done the Pikes Peak Drive many times and have never seen any animals besides pica and marmots.  In Colorado Springs, Garden of the Gods is gorgeous and free and has a lot of great hiking and also Red Rock Canyon which is basically just an extension of Garden of the Gods but across a busy highway, is all so a good hiking spot. If you're a climber, Red Rock Canyon allows technical climbing while Garden of the Gods does not.  Durango is a fun little town, some of the mountain towns are great, Great Sand Dunes National Monument is very unique and beautiful although he can get hot and there can be a lot of bugs out there. Also it's in a very low area and so in the winter it can get much, much colder than the rest of the state. On the other side of the state Black Canyon of the Gunnison Park is gorgeous but I believe it's on fire right now so I'm not sure if you can visit right now. Telluride is cool, if you go to one of the mountain towns you might want to take a Jeep Tour up to the top of a 14er, that can be a real fun afternoon. Especially this year because we've had tons of rain and so the wildflowers are really In bloom this year.  I'm not too up on restaurants, but I can tell you the one and only time I went to Casa Bonita before the new owners, I could not believe how incredibly bad the food was! It was horrible, definitely not what's going and definitely a super cheesy place. If you enjoy fine dining, skip Casa Bonita. But check the reviews cuz with the new owners maybe it's better now. The diving show is cheesy as hell, it's really a thing that's more for kids than adults. I knew what you were into, there's also some cool stuff near Canon City, the Royal Gorge Bridge, dinosaur museum I believe and they're also dinosaur tracks up on Skyline Drive which is a really cool short drive along the top of a ridge, but not for those who are afraid of heights or narrow roads. There's also a really beautiful train ride through the bottom of the canyon, I like taking tourists there because of something that all ages enjoy from kids to grandparents. It's very handicap accessible and we've taken elderly people in wheelchairs several times and they've always enjoyed it.  So much more, this is just the tip of the mountain so to speak but know that Denver to Durango is a 6-hour drive with no stops at all. And they will likely take you more than 6 hours, there's two lane roads for part of the drive, I'm thinking it took us 8 hours from Colorado Springs but it's been a while. So anyway the point is the state is quite large and it can take a lot of time to travel from one area to another so take that account when you're planning.  ETA- also lots of hot springs if that's your thing, they can be a lot of fun but do your research because there's all kinds of Hot Springs. Everything from a nudist Hot Spring to Nature ones where you have to hike in, to ones that are gigantic swimming pools with a million noisy kids. So do some research to make sure you're getting exactly what you want."

,comment,USA,Atlanta; Colorado; Florida; Georgia; Miami; Orlando; ,2025-07-22 01:55:12 UTC,1,Here’s what I would do as someone who lives near the Smoky Mountains. Fly from ATL to Miami. Drive from Miami to Orlando. Fly from MCO/SFB Orlando to Knoxville TYS and rent a car for a mountain getaway. I would save the west coast trip for a trip where he comes back to America so you both could to the destination from your homes.

,comment,USA,Atlanta; Colorado; Florida; Georgia; Miami; Orlando; ,2025-07-22 05:36:53 UTC,1,"I agree with the other comments - that you should limit yourselves to the east for this trip - there is a huge amount to see, and lots of very rural areas to explore or find a cabin in - or just find a motel in a rustic town where they have good local food and maybe some live music.  Then on another trip you could both fly to say Las Vegas or Denver, and do a wonderful road-trip in those areas."

,comment,USA,Atlanta; Colorado; Florida; Georgia; Miami; Orlando; ,2025-07-22 17:17:28 UTC,1,"15 days great! Spend your days in Orlando and then take the Brightline train (3hrs and cheaper than flying) to Miami. It’s really a driving city so you probably want to rent a car but it might be price competitive to just uber depending on how far you’re going. Stay in Miami Beach (closer to south beach the better) there is so much night life and the beaches are nice, but you might find even more quiet beaches more north. Cool things to do Vizcaya, Aventura mall, walk along the inland waterways and you might see some manatees! Wynwood is a cool neighborhood worth checking out. The Everglades are cool for an airboat tour but extremely flat. If you do rent a car and have some extra time the drive from Miami to key west is a must do drive in your lifetime it’s only about 4 hours but you’re driving on the ocean! Look up pictures it’s gorgeous. Spend the night or a couple at key west!  As for smoky mountains im no expert to be totally honest im from the north east so i love the Appalachians but they are a completely different beast from out west. The Rockies are fantastic! Def more expensive though so id keep it simple this trip and plan another one out west!!"
,comment,USA,Atlanta; Colorado; Florida; Georgia; Miami; Orlando; ,2025-07-23 20:22:28 UTC,1,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate the detailed suggestions. I’ll look into everything you mentioned and try to plan accordingly. About Brightline trains though, I saw them on the internet but it saya that they are not safe - have high fatality rates. It this true? I couldn’t find much more information on them, why are they unsafe (if they are)? Also, does Amtrak run to/from Miami and Orlando?"
,comment,USA,Atlanta; Colorado; Florida; Georgia; Miami; Orlando; ,2025-07-23 20:39:11 UTC,1,The Brightline does need to increase safety protocols at certain crossing points but cars are far more dangerous. And for passengers it’s completely safe. The fatalities are all the result of pedestrian and car error but those are being straightened out through clearer barriers and horn implementation. Amtrak takes 5 to 7+ hours and the Brightline does that in half the time. So I’d definitely recommend the Brightline.

Most of the options people are posting are lovely in the summer.  But if you'd prefer to travel in the winter you probably don't want to go to Alaska, Northern Minnesota, or Maine.   In Utah there is a chance of snow at the parks, but they are mostly empty (of people) and the temps are cool enough you can hike all day with a reasonable amount of water (vs the three gallons you'd need to carry in the summer!).  I spent several months between Zion/Bryce/Capitol Reef/Arches/Canyonlands last winter and it was amazzzzzing."

However, Alaska is quite far from the UK and infrastructure there is few and far between.  Otherwise I’d recommend New England. Maybe start/end in Boston and hit up Vermont and New Hampshire for sections of the Appalachian trial and weathered mountain peaks. Coastal Maine and Massachusetts are reasonably warm in the summer and there’s plenty to see an do.   Alternatively maybe try the Great Lakes with an emphasis on Chicago and Milwaukee and a road trip up into the MI upper peninsula and maybe Voyagers NP in MN. But this area of the country is fairly flat and not awesome for hiking.  Maybe the Pacific Northwest area? Plenty of national parks. Specifically in western Washington state and western Oregon. Summer is mild there and the rainforests are truly stunning. Nice seaside towns and two bigger cities. Beautiful mountains and scenic drives too.   The last area would obviously be the Montana and Wyoming area. But I should preface there’s no cities there and it would be hard to fly into those places from the UK. But Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Glacier are some of the most beautiful places on Earth."

Oregon trail and other migration sites and unique history as a crossroads.  Right in the middle of the country and under appreciated in my opinion.

Hundreds of miles of white sand freshwater sea beaches, dozens of large inland lakes, a dozen islands, forests, river valleys, and some of the largest sand dunes in the continent.  It’s far enough north that the summers rarely exceed 85F but far enough south that you can still sunbathe, swim, and even surf four months out of the year.

The peak times to visit are always listed online.   My favorite “less visited” state to see is New Mexico.  The mountains around Santa Fe are gorgeous, and Santa Fe is a fun city. Lots to do there.   If you come in the winter, unless you enjoy winter sports, I’d recommend visiting some southern or southwestern states. Saguaro National Park outside of Tucson, Arizona is unique and breathtakingly beautiful. There are some amazing hikes there.   I will also give a shout out to Yellowstone in the winter. It is bitterly cold, but the scenery and wildlife are fantastic. Old faithful and the thermal features in the cold are amazing. You’d need to coordinate the trip with an outfitter, though. I don’t think you can just drive in. I might be mistaken on that, it’s been a while since we were there in the winter."

,comment,USA,Florida;Boston; New York;Brooklyn; Manhattan;Oregon;Pittsburgh;Cleveland,2025-07-02 07:43:22 UTC,1,These aren't underrated but if you haven't been then go.  My idea vacation in the states is somewhere no where else has. With that in mind and in no particular preference:  Santa Fe - the oldest city in the US. The architecture is just plain fun to look at and stay in.  Hawaii - Maui - the road to Hana - look it up. Then swim with the turtles.  Taking the Pacific surfliner or Coast Amtrak from San Diego to Seattle. You can hop on and off with a 15 day pass.  Estes Park the gateway to the Colorado Rockies where you can hit the highest elevation.  The Amtrak Downeaster for the foliage tour. Ends in Maine.  New Orleans is fun and food is great. It's not like any city in America.  OK some plugs for my state of Texas. Garner State Park in the hill country and Big Bend is majestic.  DC for the history and free museums as well as awesome food.  Any National Park in Utah or Montana.  The Grand Canyon then Vegas for the sheer fun guadiness.

I’m a French guy with an American friend living in Northern California, and even before meeting him, I always said that if I ever went to the US, I’d go to Los Angeles first. Why? Well, you have to thank video games like GTA or LA Noire for that.  So, what should I see in this city?"
,comment,USA,Los Angeles,2025-05-15 18:47:17 UTC,9,"* Getty Center and Villa are both free and worth the visit * Griffith Observatory, though do the hike up to it rather than taking the shuttle bus. Good views. Also free * Little Tokyo is fun * You probably have seen LA's Union Station in some type of film or TV. * The Sixth Street Viaduct Bridge gives you good views of the Los Angeles ""river"". This bridge has become a bit of a tourist attraction since its reconstruction so you can often find food trucks and whatnot in the area * I spent most of my time in Santa Monica and Venice and the food along Lincoln Blvd is just amazing. * I know its super touristy but I really enjoyed the Santa Monica Pier and the Venice Boardwalk * The Venice Canals are much, much smaller than I thought they would be. The walkways are very limited so try to go during non-peak foot traffic."

There's actually a lot on this list that you can get to without a car, my additional two cents - check out the metro system and use it to get around when possible. Esp if you're staying somewhere within walking distance of a station. Gold and Red lines were my lifelines growing up!"

If you have a car just drive to it and park in the parking lot out front, it's easy, don't forget to pay.  Probably the best view in LA. Sunset is the best time to see it, but anytime is fine.  From there try the Hollywood Forever cemetery,  lots of famous people buried there and it's a beautiful cemetery right in the middle of Hollywood across the street from Paramount Studios. Not too far from the Observatory and just a straight shot down Western.  If you want a very LA local experience, go to the Grove. Make sure that you go to the parking garage and go all the way up to the top, 360° view of the entire LA basin. The Tar pits are very close to The Grove, the museum attached to it is neat and has the largest collection of Ice Age fossils in the world.  Downtown has really gone downhill the last few years and it's not something locals do anymore. it's also not really close to the rest of the things you would want to see.

They drive you around and drop you off at the most popular spots including Venice beach, Santa Monica pier, Rodeo drive, Beverly Hills, the observatory and much more.  You get about 40 minutes in each spot to do whatever you want and you get to have lunch in the popular farmers market (fantastic food options!) I would highly recommend this tour, we did it the day before our cruise!"

Griffith observatory (don't go for sunrise seems like California is mostly too foggy for sunrise/sunset pictures there). Hollywood walk of fame, Chinese theater, Hollywood bowl. Hollywood sign. Word to the wise just wake up early with the sunrise and the traffic was non-existent on a Sunday and I did most of these in like 90 minutes.  My big thing was the La Brea tar pits.  I went to Joshua tree which is not that far. Channel Islands is another national park out there.  I would definitely recommend you book a concert or game at dodgers stadium or whatever. Lots of events and it was miserable getting around seemed like a town you talked about what event you were going to."
9,post,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 00:26:08 UTC,2,"Short trip to Chicago and Las Vegas Hi all! I was planning a short trip to Chicago and Las Vegas. The idea was to stay 3 days in Chicago and 2 days in Las Vegas, but I messed it up with the flights and booked my flight from Chicago to Las Vegas one day later than planned. This means that I now have 4 days in Chicago and just one day in Las Vegas, which I don't know if it's optimal. In any case, I can pay a cancellation fee and reschedule the flight, but my question is: is it worth it? Honestly, I'm just going to Las Vegas for the sake of having the experience and saying that I've been there, so maybe two nights and one full day is already enough, and then it makes more sense to devote more time to Chicago, which I think might be more attractive to me as a city. I am also originally from Europe and just staying a few months in the USA, so it's not the case that I can return to any of the two cities whenever I want. What do y'all think?"

,comment,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 01:34:44 UTC,6,"Vegas is just a tourist trap built on casinos.  If you are not going to see a show or something resembling art or entertainment, it's a huge waste of time.   Chicago - while it has its flaws - is a way better investment of your time if you want to experience a little bit of American culture while you are in the US.  Personally I'd skip Vegas entirely, but if you want to experience it for some reason - go for it.  A 4-hour walk down the strip tells you all you need to know about the entire town."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 06:02:46 UTC,1,"Thank you for your honest opinion! I do think one full day in Las Vegas will be enough for me.

I was also considering attending a show, but I do not know which one (too many to choose from!)."

,comment,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 06:32:53 UTC,1,"You can do a day tour to EITHER Zion or Grand Canyon NP. You won't be exploring on your own, but you'll hit the high points and hopefully that's enough for you. :D   If you want impressive nature, very different from Europe, without the National Park name tag, do a half-day tour of Red Rock Canyon. There's a variety of tour services that will get you out there. I highly recommend doing this early to avoid heat-related issues, and you get a slightly better chance of seeing animals. Do not use rideshare to get out there. Signal in the park is poor, and you will have a very hard time getting someone out to pick you up.  Skip Valley of Fire and Death Valley due to heat and distance."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 12:48:32 UTC,1,"If you can’t make it to Zion or Grand Canyon, Red Rock Canyon and Mt. Charleston are much closer to Vegas and still worth a trip."

There is more to do in Vegas than Chicago.   The Strip of course  Freemont Street experience (where the locals go to party)  Container Park (next to freemeont)  Tivolli Village has great restaurants  Arts District (cool bars and restaurants)  Chinatown  Red Rocks National park, you can drive through and walk / hike  Mt. Charlestons ski area, beautiful views while you can eat and have a beer   Chicago has:  The Bean  Millennium Park  Art museum  Other Museums  sears Tower  Good food and pizza.   However Vegas and NY compete for the best food cities in America.   Also don’t waste your time walking up and down the strip. There is a brown bus line you can use that will save your feet and also a monorail.   Don’t make a blunder and only spend one day in Vegas.

That would be the same if he said he had 4 days in Vegas and 1 in Chicago. It’s unreasonable.   Split the time evenly.   If he only does the strip he will be disappointed.

,comment,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 03:07:55 UTC,1,"A lot of people are giving you their own personal opinions.  Chicago and Vegas are very different.  If you like gambling, partying and, shows, and drinking then Vegas is good.  Vegas also has some very nice restaurants BUT Chicago is equally as good.  It's also a much cleaner and ""calmer"" city compared to NYC and has its own distinct culture.  That being said, one full day isn't a very long time and it would be about 3-4 hours flight (based on the direction of travel) and 2hrs time difference.  It will be hectic IMO but if you really want to see Las Vegas then you can do it.  Is your next destination home and where is that?"

Also I have been told that clubs can be very pricey, and I'm on a budget, so I'll just probably walk down the Strip, have a couple drinks at a bar and experience a tiny bit of the nightlife. Actually, my main motivation to stay 2 days in Las Vegas was to take a quick trip to the desert or maybe some of the National Parks.  Also I love hectic lol  Yep, next destination is home in Tucson. I could potentially cancel my last flight, which was very cheap, and then catch one the next day to Phoenix and then bus to Tucson from there. I need to think about it."

Vegas can be road trip or cheap flight material for you in the future if your one day there gives you the itch to explore it more.  Keep it as is.  I'm not anti-Vegas - you'll find plenty to do.  But also, to me Vegas feels more like ""Hey, what if this mega Cruise ship was on land and spread out more?""  It's the place you go for the express purpose of being entertained vs. I want to visit this city and explore that specific city's culture and unique quirks about it.

,comment,USA,Chicago; Las Vegas,2025-05-14 04:21:40 UTC,1,"Chicago is easily big enough to find fun things to do for four days. Especially if you’re coming in the next few months there’s constantly something fun going on the city. You could even make one day a beach day and relax if you felt like it. There’s so many neighborhoods worth exploring and different festivals in the neighborhoods all summer long. There’s also tons of live music every night of the week, including lots of free concerts in Millennium Park. There’s incredible museums and way more good food than you can eat on one trip, from super affordable to Michelin star. If you’re curious about baseball, Wrigley field is one of the best ballparks in the country, and very conveniently located in the heart of the North side. If soccer (football) is more your speed the Fire and the Red Stars are both a great time, if not exactly La Liga quality. Chicago also has incredible live theater, second only to New York."

If you just want a day at the beach though I’d honestly stay in the city. The city beaches are fantastic and you can choose somewhere more active and social with pick up sports or somewhere quiet and relaxing. The lake is absolutely lovely for a swim though no matter which you choose. I have somewhat of a bias against the Indiana lakefront because of all the heavy industry that’s visible and can impact water quality, including at the National Park."

My family of 4 (young adults) is flying to LA first week of June to watch the Dodgers game on June 3rd. We fly 6/2 and plans to stay until maybe the 4th to do some sightseeing. What’s the best beaches to see? Is It worth it to do either Disneyland or Universal studios in one day?  We also want to see the Hollywood sign/area and Griffith Observatory. What would one recommend for transportation? Rental or uber to go around LA?  We plan to either drive or fly to San Francisco on the 5th. Top on the list is to do the Yosemite tour bus in one day. Then see Golden Gate, maybe Alcatraz.  Then meet relatives in the Bay Area before flying back home.  ***Update as of 5/3/25  6-2 to 6-4 LA visit one beach later Monday; 6-3 Tuesday Griffith Observatory and hike near the Hollywood sign. Dodgers game in the early evening. 6-4 Wednesday check out, head to Morro Bay area and stay overnight 6-5 Thursday head to Sonora and stay overnight  6-6 Drive early to Yosemite 6-7 Bay Area-&gt; Where to stay coming from Yosemite?

,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 17:18:23 UTC,4,"This sounds like a lot packed into a week. Disneyland or Universal would be a full day. Yosemite would be a full day and honestly it’s worth spending much longer than that, even if you began and ended the day already there instead of traveling to &amp; from. Dodgers game will take up half a day, Griffith will take half a day, etc.  How important is LA vs SF? It would be significantly less stressful to pick one city and “do it well” instead of trying to run around both cities and barely see either one"
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 17:23:38 UTC,3,Honestly we’ve been to DisneyWorld and Universal Orlando so to me Disneyland or Universal is not as important. I’d rather see as many nice outdoor places in LA. San Francisco is a must for us so we can see relatives and hit Yosemite.  Only our youngest son has not seen the Golden Gate.  So we are kind of flexible in San Fran. If my cousin is available maybe tour Palo Alto and see the new Apple grounds.
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 17:28:48 UTC,2,"Ok cool, in that case I would definitely recommend skipping them- the Florida versions are pretty much the same. You can also skip Hollywood since that’s a dirty tourist trap even worse than Times Square. If you’re active, there is a hike from Griffith Observatory to the Hollywood Sign where you can actually stand right behind the sign - much more fun way to “do Hollywood” than visiting the neighborhood - but that would lock up a whole day of your schedule so it depends  Your username mentions KPop. For what it’s worth, LA Koreatown is the biggest in the country. Lots of great food options. If you speak Korean you can also get entry to some places where no English is spoken  Huntington Gardens are probably the best outdoors place in LA  As far as beaches go, Santa Barbara is awesome but that’s another day trip. The seven days is very quickly being filled up haha"
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 20:08:07 UTC,3,If you choose to do a day at universal I highly recommend spending the extra money and getting the VIP you get on every ride immediately they lead you in bypassing the lines and the next available ride you're  on. You get an amazing buffet lunch and extended studio tour When we went Mario kart ride was brand new the wait over 2 hours we were on in 10 minutes
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 23:59:00 UTC,3,"I think Yosemite is a 6 hour drive one-way from San Francisco.    In LA you’ll want to be sure and see Griffith, have lunch is West Hollywood to hopefully see some famous people.  Getty Museum if also kind of a must.  The views of the city are amazing without the art.    Santa Monica is the classic Baywatch type beqch. If you drive to San Francisco, stop in San Luis Obispo or Paso Robles.  The mission in San Luis Obispo is well maintained and in the heart of the city.    If you can detour, go to Hearst Castle in San Simeon.  It’s West of Paso Robles. Stopping in Silicon Valley can be interesting if you can get a tour pass of Apple/Netflix/Google. The site seeing busses in San Francisco are easily the best way to understand the city, Alcatraz is a slow grog.  But you can say you’ve been there.    The North side of Golden gate is more spectacular than the south.  Plus you’ll be 30 minutes from Giant Redwoods.  There’s a nice little pub called Pelican Inn just outside the state park.    It might be too late to plan a trip to Yosemite if you’re not staying the night there.  But I’d check the Hospitality tents cabins."

,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 19:26:33 UTC,2,"Rent a car.  Use one day for Universal and one day for Disney/California Adventure.  School is still in session in that area so go during the week and avoid the crowds.  This Universal is where they actually shoot movies and TV shows.  You will see a lot of sets that you will recognize.  It totally different than Florida.  Disney land is the original  Smaller but still worth the visit as is California Adventure.  Beverly Hills is unique to see where the rich and famous shop.  Hollywood to be is kind of dumpy.  Santa Monica Pier and beach are nice.  Lots to see and do.  Oh, and there's lots of traffic."
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 23:53:31 UTC,2,"I've lived in both areas- you will need a car. California is not that great for Uber except within SF in my opinion. BART and CalTrain are great too. In SF try Waymo. It's an adventure.  Do Griffith Park and Dodgers Game in the same day as they are close to one another.  Skip Hollywood. Dirty and a waste of money. If you want the Hollywood feel and need an amusement park go to Universal. This also is not to far from Griffith/Dodgers Stadium.   Disneyland is 1.5+ hours in heavy traffic to and from the Dodger Stadium area.   As others said, Venice and Santa Monica are classic beach areas. I prefer Santa Monica but not by much. If you have the time go to Manhattan or Redondo.   You have one night to do SF and Yosemite. You must pick one or the other. I live in the Bay Area and have for 8 years. I have not done everything in SF yet.  Yosemite has a reservation system as of a week or two ago. Without a reservation don't bother. Yosemite is a 3-4 hour drive from SF.   If you choose SF you can  book Alcatraz ahead of time but watch out for weather. That water is rough and it can be a bad boat ride.  If you want to do the Cable Cars buy a ticket ahead of time too. Those lines get long."
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-02 14:19:01 UTC,2,Boy that’s a lot!  In la I would pick one amusement park for one day. Second day I would go to the Huntington gardens in Pasadena until early afternoon and then go down and stay in manhattan beach overnight. I’d drive up the coast the next day stopping in Santa Barbara for lunch. Then spend the night on moonstone beach drive in cambria. The next morning go look at the town and the elephant seals before you continue on to Yosemite.
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-02 16:17:21 UTC,2,"Book Alcatraz now, it fills up fast.  If you drive in SF don’t leave anything in your car.  It’s definitely not as bad as they show it on media but car break ins are always rampant!"
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-02 17:16:48 UTC,2,"Skip the theme parks, drive 395 and go through Yosemite from the east side, spend the night there. Then drive across the valley to the Monterey/Santa Cruz area and take skyline drive into SF. Plenty of amazing coastline, and beaches. Way better drive+ views coming into SF.   You'll see a whole big chunk of the most beautiful parts of the state."

,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-02 19:07:41 UTC,2,"Def do a rental car, ubering all over will cost a fortune and be exhausting  I'd say the sideshow + scene at Santa Monica and/or Venice Beach is totally worth seeing, although the swimming in the water part is probably hit or miss, best beach to actually lay on a towel and vibe is Zuma imo (alot of malibu and pac palisades where the best beaches are is still recovering from the fires so keep in mind).  I'd say for young adults group disney/universal isn't necessary..  This might be a bummer to hear but man that bus from SF to Yosemite all in one day sounds like an absolute nightmare to me...not worth it at all given the crowds and craziness...I'd do a separate Yosemite/Sierras trip if you really wanted to do that..there's a ton of amazing alternatives though!  Marin Headlands/Muir Woods/Big Basin/Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park are all world class outdoor recreation areas nearby that're worth exploring and so much closer you'll have such a better richer time.  Even just in SF you can go explore all over Golden Gate Park, check out the Presidio, go down to Sutro Baths and Fort Funston, run over to Sausalito -- maybe even rent and bike over there via the GG bridge...a lot more time spent doing than waiting on a bus..especially after driving all the way up from LA to SF..that's a lot of sitting on your butt time imo  If you're dead set on Yosemite I get it but its like a good 4 hours each way from SF and is a crazy ass drive up Priest Grade to get into the park...but if you do def go check out El Cap, and maybe go to the Nevada/Vernal Falls trail..but please for the love of god follow the signs and listen to instructions, every year a swimmer who ignores the sign is swept over the waterfalls.   Alcatraz is very cool, best tourist attraction in SF imo, but you can ferry to Angel Island nearby too and there's stunning hiking and views of the city.   The apple HQ is in Cupertino which is totally vanilla af suburb, it's like a 10 minute ""oh wow this is kinda cool"" and that's it, I think going into North Beach or Chinatown in SF would be way more enjoyable and culturally rich way to spend an afternoon.  No matter what it'll be a blast...but please..seriously consider going into Henry Cowell or Big Basin v the bus to Yosemite...it's absolutely stunning Redwood forest that's just as awe inspiring as Yosemite Valley with like a 45 minute drive v 4 hours"
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-02 23:52:13 UTC,2,Thanks for this. We will definitely take it into consideration.
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-03 00:10:02 UTC,2,"LA is one of my favorite places in the US (we've gone there 12-13 times for about 85 total days.  The famous beaches are Malibu (not worth it) and Venice Beach/Santa Monica Beach and Pier (adjacent to each other). Less well known are Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach. All 3 of those are going to feel like small beach towns with less traffic and still great beaches, plus not too far from LAX. Redondo Beach will have some great shops and restaurants on it.  If all you want to do is ""see"" the Hollywood sign, you can see it from multiple locations, including from Griffith Observatory. You will be even closer if you went to Bronson Cave (the Bat Cave from the 1960s Batman TV show), and even closer still if you got up by the Hollywood Reservoir (I think that's what it was we were looking for when we spotted a grassy park area that was extremely close to the sign).   I personally would get a rental vehicle. Be prepared for a lot of traffic--it's not that bad as long as you're prepared for it and know that it's going to take longer than you expected to get someplace. We only used an Uber once--going from LAX to Pasadena...it took us longer than it would have if we had driven ourselves but it could just have been heavier than usual traffic."

,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-03 07:03:19 UTC,2,LOLOLOLOL.  Not workable at all.  You are talking about doing maybe 10+ days worth of stuff in like 5 days.
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-01 21:51:27 UTC,1,"You might look into renting a car in LA and dropping it off in SF. I'd probably recommend driving from LA to Yosemite, and then on to SF from there: Sequoia National Park is also along the way and worth visiting as well. Note that you may now need reservations for Yosemite.  As far as beaches are concerned your classic destinations are Venice Beach or Santa Monica Beach. The coast along Malibu is quite spectacular, though unfortunately it's at least partially closed off now due to the fires earlier this year. I'd agree that Hollywood itself isn't all that interesting, but Grauman's Chinese Theater is fun and a good place to see a movie, though I wouldn't expect it to take up a full day.  LA actually has a really good museum scene; the Getty Center in particular looks like the lair of a Bond Villain and has amazing views of the city. Also free admission (though you do have to pay for parking).  Disneyland is fun, and the California Adventure park is probably not something recreated in DisneyWorld, though I wouldn't put it at the top of my personal list if you're only in the area for a few days.  Note that if you do want to do Alcatraz you'll need to make reservations for a ferry in advance."

We will definitely look into your suggestions.  Our plans will most likely evolve in the next couple of days as we look into some of the great places in California.  Theme parks are out for us. We will look into the scenic routes.  What is the weather like around the Joshua Tree, Sequioa and Yosemite and some other state parks mentioned here in June?  I’d love to explore the idea of seeing some of these parks but worry about weather conditions and driving in too isolated areas."
,comment,USA,Fremont; Golden Gate; Hayward; Hollywood; Oakland; San Francisco; San Mateo,2025-05-03 05:35:09 UTC,2,"Joshua Tree is extremely hot in summer. It's ok if you want to see an amazing desert landscape but you would have to be well prepared. IMHO probably not worth it on your time scale. It's a 3 hr drive from LA.  The Sierra Parks will be pretty warm to hot by then but not as bad as the desert, since they're at higher elevations. Check out target locations at [weatherspark.com](http://weatherspark.com) for the month you'll be there. More info than you'd want to know and very useful."

Come up with your own plan without lazy AI  Day 2 is not enough. LACMA right now is under renovation so it is not worth visiting. This means you have extra time to do different things.  Day 3: Hood Life Tour sounds dumb. Hollywood is a dirty neighborhood and tourist trap, skip it. Don’t do any of this haha  Day 4: I don’t know what this viewpoint is. You can hike to the sign from Griffith Observatory. The binoculars building is not downtown and that diner is not downtown either.  Day 6: Those are dangerous neighborhoods for a tourist. Do not do this  Getty Center is a VERY GOOD IDEA. You should go. It is wonderful.  Also visit the Huntington Gardens. It is also really good.  San Bernardino is not on the way to Lancaster so this lunch place makes no sense.  Yosemite requires several full days"

No on Compton. The inside of the Peterson is really cool imo. Palm Springs is really not a day trip. You would be better off either going to Pasadena to spend the day at the Huntington. Or going down to manhattan beach to eat wander and beach it. Or driving down to Laguna beach for the same. Finally on your cool downtown day. Add the Bradbury building and Olvera street. Bradbury is across the street from grand central and will only require 10 minutes of your time but is beautiful.

Depends upon the neighborhood. Leimert has some great food and a museum. It’s a short tourist stop. Long Beach has some great architecture and museums and a world class aquarium that I highly recommend. And whale watches leave from there. And it has the Queen Mary. It has some very bad neighborhoods that I don’t go to and that are not touristy so you won’t be there. You could just cruise Crenshaw blvd and get some food but I don’t associate Crenshaw or Compton with tourism.

Parking in Yosemite tends to be very crowded, they don’t always have designated RV space, and some of the roads into the park are twisty.

I’m sure someone else, either here or one of the California subs can help with that. But assuming that’s resolved, that could probably work.  As for Sequoia, yes, I think two days in Sequois and King’s Canyon makes more sense than one in Yosemite. But you should get more opinions on it, maybe from one of the RV subs (I can provide other sub links later). I’m an old guy who tends to be more conservative about driving."

I don’t mean to get you nervous about this. It’s mostly that I’m getting more cautious about driving in my old age.

Well done. I have seen you have done your research. It's still not perfect but at least you have a good start. LA is one of those places where you should do your research or have a local show you around. A 2. The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is in the miracle mile area (where LACMA is). That is definitely an interesting museum worth checking out. it's done by the same people who put on the Oscars each year. 3. Don't spend too much time in Hollywood. 4. You should visit Griffith Observatory at sunset. 5. In downtown LA, include a visit to Little Tokyo, Union Station, Olvera St, Disney Concert Hall, and the LA Central Library. Binoculars building is in Venice not dtla. 6. While in downtown, see if the Lakers or Kings are having preseason games. Going to a game is a GREAT way to wrap up your day in downtown. Preseason games are cheap as well. 7. You can also consider seeing the Dodgers but it'll be more expensive. 8. California Science Center by itself can be a full day if you have kids, let alone the Natural History Museum and surfing lessons the same day. 9. Have you considered going to Disney or Universal? Since you have young kids, Disney might be a better fit. 10. Cut Palm Springs and give yourself more time in LA. 11. Yosemite will be California's highlight for you. 12. Definitely do the Getty Center and consider the Getty Villa as well. Both free. 13. Also consider Huntington Library. 14. Consider going down to Long Beach and seeing the Queen Mary or next door to San Pedro and see the USS Iowa and Korean Friendship Bell. Great views. 15. While you are here, make sure you get In N Out and some street tacos at a minimum. 16. Check the rocket launch schedule from Vandenberg. Sometimes you will see rocket launches from SpaceX in the sky if they launch right after sunset  Hopefully this is helpful for you. If you don't mind, I'm wondering where you are coming from."

If not, you may want to allow more time to get acclimated.  A lot of the roads you'll be driving on going to and in the National Parks will be fairly narrow and somewhat curvy, with a change in altitude as well.  It may seem like a good idea to build in a little extra time for your road trip if at all possible.  And, if you haven't traveled in an RV before, you may be surprised at how long it takes to get set up at each RV/campsite each day.  Have you looked into booking a camping spot IN the National Parks on your list?  I ask because the RV Parks you've listed may say they're close to the ENTRANCEs of the Parks, but in reality, the entrances are still quite a drive away from the center of the Parks where the things you will want to see and do are located.  If you haven't already done so, with the limited time you've allowed in each park, it would be best to look into staying at one of the campsites WITHIN each park, instead of outside the parks so you can maximize your Park experience.  There may or may not be availability, but if there is, you should take it over staying outside of the parks.  Is there a reason you're moving campsites between Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon?  Frankly, with limited time, I'd probably choose to stay at the same site near Sequoia for two nights instead of relocating so that I could have a full day in Sequoia National Park.  Kings Canyon is fine, but with limited time, Sequoia is more memorable and a full day there more worthwhile than moving and rushing to squeeze in another National Park.  Finally, be aware that at higher altitudes and in Northern California temperatures at night start to cool down during your trip.  Be sure to bring appropriate clothing!  Here are several websites that you should carefully look through while planning your trip.  They'll help you make the most of your trip with reliable information.

Too much detailed planning. Leave more time open for kids to run and blow off steam.  Most of your LA plans are not geared to kids. The Getty museum is great, but your kids are too young, not at all kid friendly for your children’s ages. Palm Springs good option. Or, drive to San Diego and take kids to zoo or Legoland.  The camper trip sounds great."

I’m a French guy with an American friend living in Northern California, and even before meeting him, I always said that if I ever went to the US, I’d go to Los Angeles first. Why? Well, you have to thank video games like GTA or LA Noire for that.  So, what should I see in this city?"
,comment,USA,Los Angeles,2025-05-15 18:47:17 UTC,9,"* Getty Center and Villa are both free and worth the visit * Griffith Observatory, though do the hike up to it rather than taking the shuttle bus. Good views. Also free * Little Tokyo is fun * You probably have seen LA's Union Station in some type of film or TV. * The Sixth Street Viaduct Bridge gives you good views of the Los Angeles ""river"". This bridge has become a bit of a tourist attraction since its reconstruction so you can often find food trucks and whatnot in the area * I spent most of my time in Santa Monica and Venice and the food along Lincoln Blvd is just amazing. * I know its super touristy but I really enjoyed the Santa Monica Pier and the Venice Boardwalk * The Venice Canals are much, much smaller than I thought they would be. The walkways are very limited so try to go during non-peak foot traffic."

I try to prioritize a stop here anytime I'm visiting town, esp since it's right by Union Station and I enjoy taking the metro when I'm in town. There's actually a lot on this list that you can get to without a car, my additional two cents - check out the metro system and use it to get around when possible. Esp if you're staying somewhere within walking distance of a station. Gold and Red lines were my lifelines growing up!"

Someone said to visit the Huntington Library in Pasadena and I would second this. It’s great. Get there when it opens and stay until they close. You won’t regret it.  The food isn’t the best (not that it’s terrible) but sunset dinner or drinks at Yamashiro is also great for tourists: great views and cool old building. Don’t expect great food.

Then got Korean food downtown for lunch before going to Angels Point to take a beat and enjoy the views.  After that went to a lookout point close to the Hollywood sign, then went down and saw the walk of fame, Chinese theater, etc. Hit this outdoor mall after (The Grove?) that was cool.  Then drove down west on sunset blvd at sunset which was magical and turned onto rodeo drive before heading southwest to meet a friend for a sushi din before dropping the car back off at the airport and taking my redeye.

,comment,USA,Los Angeles,2025-05-16 05:00:36 UTC,1,"I just moved from Los Angeles after 20 years, I lived in Hollywood.   Folks have mentioned the Griffith Observatory - this is a must. If you have a car just drive to it and park in the parking lot out front, it's easy, don't forget to pay.  Probably the best view in LA. Sunset is the best time to see it, but anytime is fine.  From there try the Hollywood Forever cemetery,  lots of famous people buried there and it's a beautiful cemetery right in the middle of Hollywood across the street from Paramount Studios. Not too far from the Observatory and just a straight shot down Western.  If you want a very LA local experience, go to the Grove. Make sure that you go to the parking garage and go all the way up to the top, 360° view of the entire LA basin. The Tar pits are very close to The Grove, the museum attached to it is neat and has the largest collection of Ice Age fossils in the world.  Downtown has really gone downhill the last few years and it's not something locals do anymore. it's also not really close to the rest of the things you would want to see. Someone mentioned the Sixth Street bridge, which is pretty far away from everything and I don't think worth a trip to see a random brand new bridge. Google it."

Griffith observatory (don't go for sunrise seems like California is mostly too foggy for sunrise/sunset pictures there). Hollywood walk of fame, Chinese theater, Hollywood bowl. Hollywood sign. Word to the wise just wake up early with the sunrise and the traffic was non-existent on a Sunday and I did most of these in like 90 minutes.  My big thing was the La Brea tar pits.  I went to Joshua tree which is not that far. Channel Islands is another national park out there.  I would definitely recommend you book a concert or game at dodgers stadium or whatever. Lots of events and it was miserable getting around seemed like a town you talked about what event you were going to."

We’ll be spending around 4 days in florida (Disney etc) and 5 days in NY (visiting family and sightseeing). We’re a family of 5 with young kids. We have another 5/6 days and plan to visit another place for that. We’re thinking a beach town? Any suggestions  I’m not sure if we’ll have a car (haven’t decided yet)

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-04-15 19:19:45 UTC,2,"Best beaches are probably in the Mid-Atlantic.  I understand Myrtle Beach is kind of trashy, but I like Virginia Beach, Ocean City, Rehoboth Beach.  Nice sandy beaches and warm ocean water."

It is not what you're coming from.  If you've never experienced dew points over 80 or situations where the AC literally can't keep up, don't do it with five people.  There are nice spots north of NY.  Expensive, but nice."
,comment,USA,Florida,2025-04-17 00:49:29 UTC,2,"If you’re driving the. I’d stop “mid way” and visit either the Outer Banks of NC or visit Washington DC.  The OBX (Outer Banks) are incredibly historic (first recorded flight in the world, Americas first coast guard, the settlers landed there, etc…) and beautiful. We still have wild horses that call the beaches home. It’s one of the most family friendly places you can take kids (especially the giant sand dunes).  DC speaks for itself. It’s the center of US politics and loaded with all kinds of things to do. It’s also incredibly easy to get around without a vehicle."
,comment,USA,Florida,2025-04-17 15:50:34 UTC,2,"4 days in FL (Disney etc.) - if you are counting arrival and departure days as part of that 4 days. You'll have time to do part of Disney. Maybe a tough theme park day and a day at Epcot or the studio. If not, you could also go to Universal studios, or maybe a bus tour to NASA, if that's of interest.   5 days in NY, sounds like you have a plan for that.   5/6 days beach town. You'll probably need a car to do that on the east coast. You could easily drive the Delaware beaches which are easiest to access for what you have planned. I'd fly into Philadelphia if that's your choice. Bethany is more quite, rent a house kind of place. Ocean City, MD is a bit more rowdy boardwalk and bar kind of place, you could hotel it or rent a house. Rehoboth Beach, is crowded AF and Washington DC checks out in August to go to Rehoboth. That said, if you still decide to go and there's room, go to Cape Henlopen State Park instead of the public beach. Option, stay in Lewes, DE. You can still go to Henlopen for ocean beaches or you can go to bay side beaches. Short drive to Rehoboth for restaurants and shopping. Do make reservations for dinner every night. Also go to Capriotti's for sandwiches."

Also, do not play with the Florida sun. It will roast you in no time at all. Sunscreen at 50+ SPF for Irish skin. Reapply. Use any method to keep it off you.

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-04-18 17:32:07 UTC,1,Agree. I live here half the year and leave in the summer because it is so hot.  I go up to Maryland.... the Delaware beach towns of Rehoboth or Bethany Beach or Maryland's Ocean City would be my recommendations for beaches.

If you like museums, you might want to consider visiting Washington DC.  It will probably be very hot and muggy, but all of the Smithsonian museums (just about every museum there) are free, as is the National Zoo (though you'll need to reserve passes). Easy to get around on mass transit."
,comment,USA,Florida,2025-04-16 11:56:53 UTC,1,"Florida beaches in August will be absolutely brutal with heat and humidity. Personally, I would skip any beaches in Florida and go to the beaches in New York. Not only will it be crazy hot in Florida at that time of year, but it’s pretty dead because it’s off-season there. Conversely, there are great beaches in the New York area. If you have kids, they might enjoy going to Cape May New Jersey for beaches. Of course there are more beaches in the Jersey shore or on Long Island of New York. Another cute one is Rehoboth Delaware.   You’re definitely gonna need a car for Florida and if you decide to go to any of the beaches in the north east, you’ll need a car as well. And if you’re willing to go a little further, Cape Cod is always incredible and filled with Irish people lol."

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-04-18 14:59:54 UTC,1,"August is terrible in FL, especially Orlando. It's a hot valley. If you've are sure you want to do it - plan your days so you get out to the parks early in the morning. Plan to leave mid day when it's most crowded and super hot - go back to the hotel, swim, nap, eat. Go back to the park in the later afternoon (4?) when people who have stayed all day poop out. Stay until the park closes.   If you are going to NY, and can put orlando off to another trip, try the northern US - Yellowstone, great lakes beaches (western mi is great) There's a great amusement park and a separate water park in sandusky ohio. (Not the disney experience, but older kids may like it better). Regardless, the weather in these areas is so much more pleasant than the south in the summer."

I go to Florida only during the winters, and also avoid Orlando as I’m not a fan. I think the best of florida is the small old beach towns. But I get if you are trying to do it for the kids. It’s going to be absolutely boiling though. No breezes in the middle of florida.   In august the summer is at its best in the northeast. Cape Cod has pretty beaches. Islands off of it like Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are also prime for tourists. It’s busy season but that is where lots of people go to from all over in the summer.   Coast of Maine, Cape Elizabeth is where I would visit. More rocky coast but great small towns and less crowded than cape cod area."

Montauk NY is the most accessible beach from nyc without a car as the LIRR has (crowded) express trains in the summer. Montauk beaches are nice but no boardwalks or other touristy things besides the lighthouse, it’s less carnival-beach feeling and more surf town.

I'll be landing in New York but plan to spend most of my 10 day trip in the Sunshine State because I don't want to freeze to death.  I would ideally like a relaxing trip rather than being on the move every day, but I'd also feel guilty for wasting away my vacation if I sit by the beach all day. I prioritize new &amp; enriching experiences over just ticking off cities from a list and I love beautiful sceneries and historical places. I'm not looking for thrilling or adrenaline-packed activities as I'd prefer not to be worn out by the end of the day.  I'm curious about:  &gt;The best places to visit?

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 03:38:38 UTC,3,"Definitely rent a car. Florida is a big long state and traveling from spot to spot, town to town will be extremely expensive and difficult to do by Uber/taxi  St. Augustine is where the conquistadors landed, might be a good place to start. Orlando, Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, Naples, Sarasota might be some cities you’d want to check out. You’re gonna have to prioritize and do some research tho, bc it’s too much ground to cover for a 10 day trip.   Have fun!"

If you have kids stay away from Panama beach and Miami. Tallahassee is boring this time of year ( no football) Gainesville is boring for the same reasons.

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 12:50:07 UTC,2,We are having a cold weather so not sure about the beaches but depends on what part of FL you are going to as it is a big state. I also think your best bet is Uber as driving here is crazy.
,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 13:13:15 UTC,2,"Are you flying into Florida or driving from New York? If driving, that alone will eat up an entire day of your vacation (2 if you don't want to do the whole drive in one go). Everyone has given great recommendations (I concure with St. Augustine.) But if you are going to do multiple cities you will definitely need a rental car and to plan everything out with drive times. Florida is a big state and with traffic it can take 3-5 hours going from Cocoa Beach to Tampa/ St Pete, and 5-6 hours from Jacksonville to Miami and don't even get me started driving from the Panhandle."

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 16:06:31 UTC,2,"I’d start in St Augustine as most have suggested. The town should still be set up with millions of lights into February. It’s really pretty. Check out Llama Restaurant. They have a vegetarian menu. Head south to New Smyrna Beach. Super cute beach town that you could spend an afternoon in browsing the shops, galleries and drive on the beach (with appropriate car.) We love to eat dinner at The Garlic. It has a beautiful garden patio. Continue south to Brevard County: visit Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge (Black Point Drive if you enjoy birding), Cocoa Beach (Ron Jon’s famous surf shop). Restaurants: The Tiny Turtle, The Green Room Cafe, and Peace in the Garden. Cocoa Village may also be worth a stop to browse the little shops. Continue south to Palm Beach County. Jupiter area beaches are great. Dubois Park. Palm Beach Gardens for shopping and dining. Head over to Palm Beach (island) and browse Worth Ave, the Breakers, look for shark’s teeth on the beach. Guanabanas in Jupiter is a lovely place to dine outdoors."

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 16:22:08 UTC,2,"I just came back from St. Augustine from a 2-week vacation at a beach condo. I went there to see the lights which are on display until I think the 28th of January. Nevertheless, we had a cold spell and unprecedented amounts of visitors so I didn't get to see the lights afterall. I would recommend hiring black car service and taking a tour of the lights downtown and if you just feel like staying in the condo on the beach then go for that. It might just be the relaxing vacation you need. The city will of course be busy and lots of activity and people. So if you get a place down there it'll be a whole different vibe. My friend recommends Marion motor Lodge. St. Augustine is a very walkable City. It's not that big but it will be crowded as long as the lights are on display"

Saint Augustine Beach, Butler Beach, Crescent Beach are farther from town. Someone suggested a hotel downtown that overlooks the  bay  front would be fun, because everything is within walking distance and safe downtown."
,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 16:45:02 UTC,2,"Anna Maria Island - Gulf coast, beautiful old Florida feel.  Itchetucknee Spring/River - state park, the spring water is a constant 68 degrees F year round, so it's very cool, but tolerable once you get used to it, after your initial plunge. You can ride an inner tube down the river, which is pristine.   In Orlando, make sure you visit Gatorland. Its like a zoo for Florida wildlife. Its the oldest theme park in Florida, pre-dates Disney.   Don't swim in any freshwater bodies of water. Assume all lakes, ponds, drainage ditches, etc. have alligators in them. They are there, even if you can't see them. Swim in pools, or the ocean. If you see a gator, don't get near them, they can charge explosively and cover a sizeable distance quickly. They are extremely dangerous, and they kill people and eat pets every year. Do not feed them under any circumstances. They are not to be taken lightly.   You'll find lots of Indian restaurants that will cater to your preferences, especially in cities like Orlando, Tampa, and Miami.   You will need a car, Florida mass transit is not good at all. Taking cabs will cost far more than a rental."

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-14 18:07:53 UTC,2,"10+ year Florida resident here! Definitely rent a car. You'd be spending twice as much in ubers rather than renting a car. St. Augustine was already mentioned here, but just saying it again to make sure you go! It's so nice. I'd recommend staying at a beachfront airbnb in Flagler Beach (it's such a small, nice, cute and relaxing town) and it's like 40 min from St. Augustine.  Also, if you have the time and if the weather is above 70 (it should be at the end of january/beginning of february) please please PLEASE visit one of the springs!! Ginnie Springs is my favorite but there are many others. And if you love beautiful sceneries you need to visit the Devil's Den Prehistoric Spring (a 45-min drive from Ginnie Springs). Seriously look up pictures and videos. This place is insane!  Also, if you are in SoFlo at some point of your trip here are the vegetarian recs:  SoBe Vegan (many locations across SoFlo)  Pura Vida (many locations across SoFlo)  Stephanie's Vegan Bakery and Cafe in Fort Lauderdale  The Last Carrot in Coconut Grove  Enjoy!"

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-16 16:24:17 UTC,2,"Over all the entire state of Florida “except for Miami” SUCKS for food. We spent over 2 years traveling all over Florida for work. You can find some mom and pop shops that cook local caught seafood that are pretty good. Smokin D bbq outside of fort Augusta is the only bbq in the state worth eating. You may not be super thrilled by the food. That being said, Miami is its own animal all together. If you want good food in Miami try “Charles and Larry” and have them guide you. It’s Venezuelan street food, there is a lot to choose from, let them be your guide. “Bring a translator of some type” Miami is predominantly Spanish speaking. Try I-krave for the oxtail and grits. Plaza seafood has some decent food, it’s fried mostly. El Palacio de los jugos “on Flagler” we don’t like the other one. They rent spaces to different people who make different food types. So you walk through pick what all you want. So you can get one thing say “chicken” at one counter and beans and plantains at another. They have a LOT of choices.  Fort Augusta is well worth going to and hitting up the museums. If the beach isn’t what you’re looking for and you want scenic drive the over seas highway. You can hit multiple state parks, museums. The Mel fisher museum and a lot of treasures from the atocha. Also can hit up Hemingway home. You can take a ferry or short flight to dry tortugas. Fantastic drive with a lot to see.. and surprisingly to most people, no beaches to speak of. The keys are the 3rd largest barrier reef on earth. The very few sand beaches they have are man made. They haul in the sand. You can take a ferry out of Hollywood or Fort Lauderdale “I don’t recall which” to the Bahamas. If you go to Hollywood the hit the boardwalk and pop into taverna opa. Might find the crazies dancing on tables and having a great time. Highway 41 “the tamiami trail is a great drive in my opinion. I think much more interesting than alligator alley.  If you want to hit the beach and have space. Canaveral national seashore. Daytona beach boardwalk is nice. The whole south west coast is rebuilding from hurricanes so, tough to say where to go there. We loved fort myers beach. We also enjoyed haulover beach. Mexico beach is nice, but I’m not sure how bad that section got hit this last time. Tampa took it face first, so.. Pensacola is worth the time as well. We didn’t care at all for Jacksonville. But Neptune beach was super nice. Orlando of course. We prefer universal studios to Disney, Florida has very clean roadways, and it’s very green. So mostly very pleasant driving. If you can run right next to the coast, we found the most interesting drives on those little 2 lane roads along the beach front. You won’t see the beach much anywhere, the plant life and growth patterns can be stunning. A long with road side art."

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-13 21:29:17 UTC,2,"I would second St. Augustine. It really depends what you're looking for - if you're looking for the best beaches I would say the Keys and Destin have those, but pretty much all of them are nice. I'm fond of St. Petersburg, FL but that's partially because I grew up there. I would really recommend renting a car because nothing is walkable for the most part, unless you're staying in a downtown area or a hotel on the beach.   As for safety or racial concerns, I don't think you have anything to be worried about especially in touristy areas. I don't know of anyone with racial concerns against Indians - I wouldn't worry about that."

,comment,USA,Florida,2025-01-13 22:19:19 UTC,1,"Well Orlando is right in the middle - whether or not theme parks are up your alley is another story. I prefer nature over the overpopulated, traffic-ridden madness that is Orlando personally. However, if any of those parks tickle your fancy, I'd say it's worth a stop.  Personally I would prefer a kayak rental to Wekiva Springs - roughly in the same area. Parking is impossible at the springs and they have a max capacity, so rent a kayak/canoe from Wekiva Island (it's a canoe outpost / restaurant) and from there it's about 2 mile paddle to the springs. The water may not look amazing at the island but the springs are crystal clear and a good time.  Might be a bit chilly this time of year, though."

I am 2 hours from Destin and am fairly cold sitting in my living room. Look at Lauderdale by the Sea for a laid back, pretty beach.  Florida is diverse and there are plenty of people from India.  No one is going to look twice. Dunedin and St. Petersburg are nice areas but it may not be warm enough to sit at the beach. Anna Maria Island is very popular and a nice area.  Key West is great and charming but the Keys have the worst beaches in the state."

14,post,USA,Florida,2024-05-05 15:48:01 UTC,113,"My first vacation in Florida coming up in about 3 months! WHAT NOT TO DO!?!? Hi all!  As the title says, I have a vacation coming up in 3 months with my family. We come from a Nordic European country, and we look forward to it a lot. But we don't like tourist traps, so the question is, what am I not supposed to do?  The trip itinerary is 2 day in Orlando, 4 in Miami, 5 in Keywest, 2 in Fort Myers, and 6 in Sarasota area. We are doing it all by renting cars from Alamo. The trip is about 3 weeks, and I have a tight schedule.  Give me your gut reaction on what NOT to do! And of course, on what to do as well, if you like.  Best regards!   **Edit:** First, thank you all for the responses. They are so helpful. To clarify, my family is composed of all adults over 25. We are quite a fit family and like the heat and love the ocean and beaches. August is the only month that was possible for us to get a vacation together as a whole family of 4.  **My notes:** 1. Get sunscreen. A lot of it! 2. Stay hydrated and bring plenty of water. 3. Wear UV-protective clothing. 4. Drive carefully and be nice to everyone. 5. Spend more days in the Keys area and less time in Fort Myers and Sarasota. Go to Tampa/St. Pete instead. 6. I will stay out of trouble. I'm just there for a nice (and hot) vacation."

Don't go swimming in the ponds and creeks unless you know there are no gators…btw there are always gators…also beware still warm water such a ponds and drainage ditches cause we have brain eating amebas that can get in to nose or ears and kill you, also we got some flesh eating bacteria too so beware if you have open wounds.  Sand is hot so wear beach shoes during daylight, night swimming at the beach is dangerous cause of sharks. Most city parks close at sundown.   In sarasota suggest going to the ringling both the art and circus museums. Selby gardens is nice if you like plants and flowers."

I went last October right after the heat wave and it was death and destruction everywhere I looked. Dead coral and algae infested reefs. Maybe tourists won’t notice as much but as a native who’s been diving his entire life it was gut wrenching to see.

Spaceflight Now (.com) has a good launch schedule, and you can use YouTube when you’re close to the launch time to keep track of the countdown. Seeing a rocket in person (especially at night) is worth all the hassle."

If you go to a table service restaurant (where a server takes your order at the table, and the food is brought to the table once it’s cooked), it’s customary to tip somewhere between 15-20% the cost of the meal. The server is paid less than minimum wage, and relies on that money to pay their rent and living expenses.  In many restaurants, the server also has to tip the support staff (bussers, food runners, etc.), and they have to do that even if they get no tip from your table. So not tipping actually costs the server money for serving you."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-05-05 16:49:57 UTC,6,"In addition to the sunscreen make sure you drink a lot of water. The heat is bad but when you add the humidity in your body will have a hard time keeping cool and you will sweat out a lot more than you realize. By the time you feel thirsty you are already dehydrated. Dehydration can be extremely dangerous and it's cumulative. So being in the heat for a few days in a row adds up. Even 1 day can land you in the hospital with kidney failure.  Do a kayak and snorkel tour at the Crystal River. It would be a bit of a drive from Orlando but it's an amazing experience. You are able to get in the water with the manatees. They are close enough that they frequently will bump into you. Plus it's great to experience them in their natural environment that they are free to come and go as they please. The summer is their ""off season"" but we have gone multiple times in the summer and still saw a bunch of them. It's also great because being in the water will give you a day to cool off.   In the Keys there is a dolphin experience that allows you to swim with the dolphins in the wild. They aren't captive animals. I don't remember what the name is though."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-05-05 17:04:52 UTC,5,"Visit the Everglades for sure, because it’s a unique ecosystem and you won’t be disappointed.   Coming at that time of year is going to be brutal, we have extreme humidity to match the heat so you’re essentially in a sauna at all times. Wear sunscreen and reapply religiously, carry plenty of water and drink more than you think you need, and keep mosquito spray handy. And don’t forget that if there is so much as a puddle of water there’s going to be a swamp puppy (alligator) in it, so don’t let small children go splashing about.   Also keep in mind it is hurricane season here and El Nina is promising the likelihood of a rough one so you may need to change destinations at the last minute."

Slow down and relax so you can go home not feeling like you need a vacation from your vacation.   Late summer is the hottest and worst weather. It’s just not a good time to be here. Even the ocean is hot that time of year (look up temps from last year if you don’t believe me). It is hot 24/7 and doesn’t cool down at night like it does where you’re from. It makes the whole day feel more tiring.   Buy UV blocking clothing now. You’re going to burn and that’s an awful way to ruin a vacation.

They won't leave you alone if they smell weakness and will harass you until you untul you buy their cheap homemade seashell crap.  Dont forget sunscreen.

Tampa has Busch Gardens , and of course the best theme and water parks are in Kissimmee.  Many of the places you've chosen are low key, not much to do, so if that's what you are looking for, then you're on the right path. St. Augustine is the oldest city in the state. Like ghost stories ?

Fort Myers - Charter fishing  Key West - Eco tours on jet skis are awesome. Snorkeling is awesome.    If you get a chance, fan boat rides through the Everglades are awesome!

Consider going from Miami to Ft Myers then hopping on the Key West Express to get to Key West.  It’s a 4 hour boat ride that you can take on any day of the week and then return as many days after you arrive as you plan.  It’ll save you literally hours of driving and lots of gas.    Orlando is the biggest tourist trap you will ever encounter in your life.  It’s something to experience one time, so go for it, but it’s freaking hot, very crowded, and expensive.  With that being said, if you do decide to go there, consider jumping on the new train that will take you from Orlando to Miami in a couple hours instead of driving.  I think it’s called the bright line?   You can rent a car anywhere, btw.  Don’t feel obligated to rent a car in Orlando so you can drive everywhere.

Florida summers are brutal and you will be too hot and miserable to enjoy yourselves. You’ll find yourselves taking refuge in air conditioned buildings and waiting until evening, when the mosquitoes come out or it’s pouring rain and the lightning drives you back inside. Last month would have been the best in terms of weather.  Treat the sun like it’s radioactive. Avoid being in direct sun when UV exposure is strongest, usually 11:00 to 14:00. Use hats, light clothing with long sleeves. Slather on the sunscreen everywhere the light touches, including ears, neck, parts in your hair (if not wearing a hat -wear a hat), hands and tops of feet. Unprotected, you can get a bad burn in 15 minutes, and sun sickness will ruin your trip.  I would loosen your itinerary to spend less time driving. It’s a long way to Miami from Orlando, and this state is not known for its pleasant drives. Maybe fly instead of drive and spend more time on the beaches."

We stayed in Orlando for 4 days, Pompano Beach 3 days and St Pete's for another 3 days before flying home from Orlando.  End of March. Make sure you know your insurance coverage for your rental before arriving.  Also book a rental that does not require prepay, in case a better rate comes up.  Check rates the closer you get to the trip.  We have coverage from our home policy but she wanted a copy of that for proof.  So if you have some other insurance that avoids their insurance fee, have proof. Do not buy toll fee from the rental company.  There is a loaner toll meter you can pick up in the airport or maybe a store outside the airport.  They will charge you $100 for toll fee when you might go through $30.  But according to your driving plans you will need a toll meter of some sort. Check your meal receipts before deciding on a tip.  Some will have the tip already charged and the server won't tell you that. Buy a sim card from Costco if you have a membership for cell phone coverage.  Less fees than buying from a dealer. Organize your days in Orlando as if you are not at a amusement park, there is not as much to do.  When you are on the coast you can always just hang out at the beach. We spent a day at Miami beach.  Flamingo park is in a bit from the beach, but has some nice features and even free parking for a few hours.  A place to get some shade. Don't drive too much.  I know we missed the keys, and will want to see that someday, but it would have been too much highway driving.  Most highway driving with Google was fine.  Sometimes it was very slow with accidents or construction.  Once it was freaky with a huge big rainstorm hard to see out  the car window with hazards going slow pylons from express lanes blocking access and a lot of cars.  Made it but it was stressful. Don't go to the beach without a plan for shade and food.  It can get really hot and you don't want to be leaving too much as parking can add up."

Always have headlights on and try to just focus on the car ahead of you. The good news is: those storms pass pretty quickly! It’ll be clear in about an hour at most!

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-05-05 18:50:54 UTC,2,August is the beginning of peak hurricane season. Considering you will be here 3 weeks I’d say you have a really good chance of experiencing a storm somewhere in the state at some point. Make sure you get refundable rates and allow yourself flexibility.  The heat index in August will be over 100 daily. It also storms daily in August. It’s extremely uncomfortable certain times of the day and heat stroke is no joke. If you are accustomed to Nordic weather be extra careful about the heat. When humidity gets this high our sweat does no good cooling us off and it’s easy to overheat in a matter of an hour. Drink electrolytes not just water. Invest in personal cooling devices of all kinds. Plan most activities for mornings and evenings. 2-5 is the most miserable hours IMO.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-05-05 22:24:04 UTC,2,"The heat and humidity are going to be much more of a factor than you probably think. Aside from the obvious tips of layering on the sunscreen, wearing a hat, and drinking more water than you think you need, it’s a good idea to try and plan activities in the morning and evening with time for a break/nap at the hotel in between. The summer weather here can sap your energy like you wouldn’t believe, give yourself a chance to recuperate and don’t try to spend the entire day out in it…or you’re gonna have a bad time.  You’ll probably see alligators, they’re really cool to watch but keep a very healthy distance, they’re faster than they look. A follow-up tip for this is don’t linger by the waters edge at lakes/canals/etc.  In Orlando, if you want to get a feel for the city don’t hang out down in the theme park areas south of town…unless you’re going to one of the parks, it’s pretty soulless. The ‘hoods north of 408 are actually quite cool and have a lot to recommend.  Especially since you’re going to Orlando *and* Miami, do not attempt to rent a car without the insurance…drivers in both are absolute maniacs.  If you’re sensitive to smells/tastes in water, avoid the tap water…it’s not unhealthy, but there is a distinct sulfur in the FL groundwater that treatment doesn’t fully eliminate."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:53:32 UTC,9,They typically don’t want to do the long drives unless they know they can get a return trip booked. Otherwise they are driving back with an empty car when they could be out making more money. And what Uber pays them for the one way isn’t worth it.

I was also breastfeeding and carrying a baby around so I’m sure that didn’t help. We swore we’d never do it again and booked our DW trip for November this year! Also I’m from the Utah desert so I thought I could handle heat. But that humidity changes everything.

This is talking from someone who lives in a parallel close to north Florida, so we get hot weather, but I have never experienced the heat that was Florida (remember Sept, technically not Summer).  The closest I have been was summer in Cairns Australia, or March in Thailand.   My tip, you need to carry a decent sized water bottle per person, and drink all day. We had 1L sized insulated one I would fill with ice from the hotel ice machine each day.  And every time you see a water fountain, fill it up again.  (or you can just buy water around the park).  Also if you take your own, get a decent filtered one.  The water in FL tastes foul.  (it's because of the brackish water everywhere I believe)"
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:07:58 UTC,163,"My thoughts (for what they are worth- I'm a local AP, living in the Tampa area):   Ubering from Tampa to Orlando? Unlikely you'll find a driver who will do that. It's an hour and a half on a good traffic day. Consider car rental. The Disney hotels do not charge for parking and you can then use the transportation. Universal hotels do charge for parking but they also have good transportation.  If you exclusively do the Harry Potter at Universal and Islands it is NOT a full day. Plus, its not a separate area, you have to enter through the UO or IOA main gate to get there.  Epic Universe will probably need two days due to how busy it will be having just opened.  I would also recommend not splitting your Hollywood studios day. It could potentially be a full-day park. Also, after spending the day at discovery cove, I doubt you'll want to schlep all the way over to Hollywood studios after you get back to the hotel, shower, change etc. Use that time to chill, eat a decent dinner somewhere, and have some additional pool time or hit up Disney Springs.  Do you have to stay at 3 different hotels in Orlando? I think you underestimate the time it's going to take to pack up and move hotels, especially if you aren't renting a car. It will be a big energy and time drain. Especially if the hotels are busy on your check-in days or if your room isn't ready. I mean, sure the hotels will hold your luggage and send it to your room but it's an extra faff you don't need. Pick one hotel for Disney. As you are staying at cabana bay, you won't get express passes as part of the package, but you will get early entry. If you are willing to sacrifice early entry, you and rent a car, you could potentially stay at a disney hotel the entire time. It's about a 20-30 minute drive to universal from disney depending on traffic."

It seems like a lot of travel to just go there for one day, is there anything else you might want to do in that area? Otherwise maybe consider skipping it this trip, you've got a lot of travel planned.  - This is a personal take but I am not a huge rope drop to fireworks kind of person every single day, are your travel companions? Unless you are very fit and used to walking 10k+ steps in 90 degree heat consecutive days, it can be very tiring.  - Water parks with no break after might also be physically difficult for similar reasons. - I think more than one day at MK would give you a better chance at doing more stuff, there's a lot to do there and the wait times can be very long in the summer (especially on a weekend).  - From a crowd perspective, your rest days might be better scheduled to be on weekend days and use the weekdays for activities. - I don't think there will be enough things to do to warrant a full day of Wizarding World stuff across parks.  - Allocating time on the schedule to enjoy lower impact stuff that's not the theme parks might also be enjoyable, like Disney Springs and CityWalk.   I guess my key takeaway is that this seems to be scheduled like more of a theme park focused marathon than a vacation, please take into consideration your energy levels and focus on enjoying your time over doing everything possible. It's going to be hot, stay hydrated, reapply your sunscreen frequently, and rest when your body needs it."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 14:32:42 UTC,10,"Great tips, we are flying into Tampa and are excited for some of the thrilling coasters BG has to offer which should blow the cobwebs off our long flight.   Will definitely not be aiming to do absolutely everything at every park, just get a few of the priorities done then enjoy the atmosphere and definitely listen to our bodies and cut days short/sleep in if needed.  Thanks for the response."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 19:52:36 UTC,5,"I honestly would not recommend flying into Tampa to do Busch Gardens (unless there's another reason).   Having to lug around luggage and taking shuttles the day after a flight and walking through a theme park seems kind of exhausting.   Why not fly into Orlando, check in to the hotel, and do a FREE roundtrip shuttle from Orlando to Busch gardens?   I'll also like to say you may be done with SeaWorld sooner than expected. Get there early to do the heavy hitters. The park is the worst for rain delays and almost everything is suspended/cancelled. There's not enough benches/seat/shade. I'd probably do the hotel reset after SeaWorld regardless what day you decide to go."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 15:11:23 UTC,7,SeaWorld has some great coasters too.  Keep your feet dry at all costs.  That much walking with wet feet is trouble.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 14:09:43 UTC,4,"Thanks, great advice. Yes we'll be bringing plenty of sunscreen with us.  Hopefully the bedbug issue is solved by summer. We were thinking cabana bay volcano view room for the wow factor but I might do a bit more research."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 15:25:40 UTC,3,"Sapphire falls and Aventura are nicer hotels and across the street from cabana bay, those hotels also have theme park views which if you get then you might be able to see hogwarts. Sapphire falls has a boat you can take to city walk which is a lot nicer than the bus. You can walk over from Aventura to use the boat too.  At universal parks, you can get ice and water at any Coke freestyle machine which are all over the place for free if you have a cup. That helps a lot in dealing with the summer heat"

I’d much rather spend more time at Disney. Your agenda has more time for Universal than Disney when Disney parks are so much bigger. I also don’t see any time for Disney Springs here? While there aren’t rides it is themed and a great place for shopping and dining. We normally spend at least one evening there during each trip.

Just bear in mind that there’s less to do at UO/IOA than there is at Disney and the parks are smaller so you may find yourselves wandering around a bit aimlessly, doing rides you don’t really want to do for a second or third time because there isn’t much else there.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 10:02:50 UTC,14,"Any reason you're changing hotels at Disney? Is it specifically to stay at AKR (it is a cool hotel) or for the extended evening hours? If for the latter, your schedule is so busy I would bet that you end up skipping the extended hours altogether for more chill time. Basically, booking the deluxe resort just for that wouldn't be worth it to me as you already have a good deal of park time.   I also find switching hotels to be a lot of hassle. Keep in mind how much packing up and moving around you are doing already. Could you maybe stay at AoA the whole time and then plan a nice meal at AKR? Or, as someone else said, do an evening at Disney Springs, which is well worth it and something I feel a 13 year old would particularly love (shopping)?  Basically, try to simplify where you can now in terms of travel and hotel reservations. Disney is huge, and you're also doing all of the other Orlando parks as well!"
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 10:41:53 UTC,14,"I disagree here, moving hotels at Disney is soooo easy. Especially when you don’t have a car, you just pack up your bags and drop them off and go about your day.  Also AKL is one of the best hotels for relaxing in, so definitely worth the swap assuming you can’t afford it for the whole Disney time."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 11:17:00 UTC,9,"Moving between hotels isn't hard but packing all your things to only check into a hotel for one night and then check out again (to check into another hotel across town!) is IMO. If they were flying out right after one relaxing final day at AKL I might say yes, but as they then have a few more days of busy park hopping it just seems like a bit too much. I've done similar to this and only stayed at AKL for one night while hotel/park hopping and I regretted it because you just can't enjoy it properly."

Not sure if it’s worth buying a whole days’ ticket for 3 hours worth of park time."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:14:11 UTC,10,Please keeping mind while you consider yourself an active family- are you sure your child really does like being very active or just goes along with the family vibe? This is an exhausting schedule but obviously you know your child (but sometimes kids will do anything to please their parents). The hotels have lots to look at and do in their own pools and you can spend great time just walking and eating on hotel campus. Also keep in mind how many people are telling you Busch Gardens sucks- waste of time and energy to go there. Sea World had a terrible documentary about it as well. That money could be spent on a nice dinner or gifts :)
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:38:54 UTC,13,"I honestly don’t know why everyone keeps saying Busch gardens sucks? I was there like 8 months ago ago and it was super fun if you like roller coasters! Like it’s an entirely different premise from Disney, but it’s still cool (tho I wouldn’t buy an annual pass there). They have an in park chick-fil-a, the rides are up and running faster than 6 flags, and they are some cool coaster construction."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 10:16:19 UTC,11,I would honestly skip both SeaWorld and Busch Gardens. Your family would have a lot more fun in the Disney parks. You’ve only put a few ours each day for HS. Honestly just exploring Galaxys Edge could take half a day.
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:51:27 UTC,2,"I would suggest moving a bit around and staying at a Universal resort if you're doing multiple days there. If you can swing it,  and as you mention considering Express, look into one of the hotels that offer that as a perk. For the cost of being walking distance from the parks you can also skip the line just for staying at one of those 3 hotels (for now, 2025 may include Sapphire Falls but it doesn't yet). And, less driving meaning more time in the parks and less overall exhaustion.   And while I have no opinion on Seaworld or Busch Gardens, I would agree that Disney is bigger. At 13 there are plenty of rides your daughter may have no interest in, but the parks are just so much bigger. It really depends on what you and your family want to ride.   My other suggestion other than staying at Universla would be to watch a few videos of the parks from Youtubers that go there and can give an overview. I like the Frugal Brit myself but there are plenty that do all the above parks. Then sit down with them and write out exactly which rides look interesting. Maybe you'll all realize that the only thing in Epcot that interests you is Guardians,  and with a park hopper you can go back to MK for more time there for example."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:04:55 UTC,6,"I would maybe consider switching one Universal day to a Disney day, but that totally depends on the priorities of your group!  Love that you're visiting Busch Gardens - I live next door and will absolutely defend that choice!  I probably wouldn't Uber from Tampa to Disney, personally, but I'm not sure what the most cost effective alternative is. There's a shuttle from Busch Gardens to SeaWorld, but I don't know how it works and then you'd still need to Uber to AoA. There's also Amtrak, but again not sure of the cost and again you'd need to get from the station to the hotel. A private transfer may make the most sense - I'd compare pricing, especially since you'd need to get one of the larger Ubers!  It's gonna be hot and exhausting but looks like a great trip!"

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:55:15 UTC,4,"A lot of people have given great advice here! I just wanted to throw in a few that I haven't seen yet:  -I'd split up your 2 rest days that you currently have on Monday and Tuesday. Also, these are great days to be at the parks because they will be less crowded than weekend days, even in the summer. I'd have at least 1 park day between the 2 rest days. (After looking back on your itinerary, I realize you're changing hotels between the rest days, but I'd still consider it. Maybe when you check into Cabana Bay you can do the afternoon at Harry Potter since you were looking to make that an entire separate day (it really doesn't need a full day), and then use that day as another rest day?)  -Since you are staying at onsite hotels/resorts, I would also take advantage of a mid day rest (when you're at the parks you can re-enter. I don't know if you can re-enter the Universal parks). That may help you regain some energy on the back-to-back park days so you can enjoy the nighttime aspect of the parks (Disney fireworks shows are really something!)  -I would highly recommend not doing any parks on the day you fly out, or at least give yourself most of the afternoon to relax or do something low key. You're going to be wiped out, and then having to fly all the way back to the UK?! Sounds exhausting! Since you have a lot of Universal time planned and that's where you will be stationed last, I'd suggest either taking a stroll through City Walk, or you can even take an Uber over to Disney Springs. There's a lot of shopping and restaurants in each spot, and could be a nice way to still ""do the parks"" one last time but also unwind a bit.  This itinerary is packed to the brim but it sounds like a lot of fun if you can make sure to not burn yourselves out!"
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:14:33 UTC,8,"Lots of great comments here. My 2 cents that’s been hinted at here: that’s a LOT of time at Universal Studios. US is great and the Harry Potter areas are amazing, but it’s not not nearly enough stuff to do for that many days. Definitely consider swapping in another Disney day."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:38:48 UTC,10,"Fellow Brit here to chime in (in fact I'll be there at the same time as you!)  You have packed a _lot_ in here, especially with all the hotel changes you may get knackered. Depending on energy levels and general vibe a 13 year old may get a bit ratty by the end. Having one base of operations to travel from can be really helpful rather than hopping this much. Even an internal Disney change of hotel with them moving the bags for you feels like it eats time and energy more than you might think (have done that twice). Being able to properly unpack knowing you'll be somewhere for a while has value!  Priorities will vary for each person but I was surprised to see Sea World getting a full day plus discovery cove - they would be my obvious places to trim to give yourself more space. Multiple parks in a day that aren't part of the same resort (e.g. discovery cove to Disney) means you will eat a fair bit of time transitioning, getting in and out etc. which may not be most efficient.  I would also flag that taking midday rests can work well. i.e. park in the morning, return to chill and swim, then back out in the afternoon/evening - that way you can slow the pace, avoid peak heat but still get some park time in rather than booking a full rest day. Plus parks stay open late and queues diminish over time, at the end of the day walk-ons get pretty common for a lot of rides.  If this were me I would be spreading the rest days more because I like to chill for at least some of a holiday but probably do fewer straight hotel rest days (you have two in a row here) - parks like EPCOT are actually pretty good for chilled wandering, exploring, drinking and eating but not if you're racing around trying to squeeze rides in.  One thing I'll say contrary to a lot of feedback here is that having done a few August trips none of us (including younger kids) find the heat all that bad, everywhere is air conditioned and you can easily stay hydrated."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 14:37:03 UTC,4,"Thanks for the reply.  Thinking when I go back to the drawing board I'll be giving HS a full day, and maybe push SeaWorld back to the 2nd week.   Definitely will be making the most of staying on resort to get out of the midday sun and some down time to rest as needed.   Hope you have a great time on your holiday, would love to see what you have planned for your trip."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 16:20:23 UTC,2,"That sounds like a solid plan - we're a bit spoiled as we know we'll be back again so don't feel quite the same pressure to get everything done.  Our trip for next year is still being worked out, we have the flights booked and a hotel but little else. We have the luxury of a bit more time so will likely be starting at Universal (two or three nights) around mid-August then staying at Disney for 14 nights.  We'll use that as a base for other things - Kennedy Space Centre is on the list for this year for example - but not sure 100% on all plans yet."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 10:59:21 UTC,18,"If you're there in summer, you need to take in to account that the lines will be LONG if you aren't forking out for the express passes, especially at Disney. This looks similar to the itinerary I had for my trip at the end of September, which was in the quieter season.  I'd also ignore people telling you to skip SeaWorld and Busch Gardens if you like rollercoasters. Iron Gwazi at BG is one of the best rides I've ever been on, and the coasters at SeaWorld are great, too."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 10:00:43 UTC,52,Skip SeaWorld (for moral reasons - it’s abhorrent) and Busch Gardens. Have more time at the Disney parks instead. You won’t regret it.   As someone else from the UK who goes for two weeks plus I would also highly recommend building in breaks into your days to go back to the resort and rest. Your feet and sanity will thank you!
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 11:06:28 UTC,17,I agree on skipping SeaWorld. Busch Gardens is a great park. Definitely a full day parks filled with great coasters. Much more to do at Busch Gardens than Hollywood Studios &amp; Animal Kingdom.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 14:16:17 UTC,4,"Local here, there’s a lot of great and similar feedback already so I’m just going to collate and emphasize the best advice IMO:  Tampa to Orlando is an expensive if not impossible Uber. Rent a car or consider dropping entirely. Sea World and Busch are good for intense coasters, but otherwise not great full day experiences. I would NOT split Hollywood Studios. Lots of hotel hopping — consider dropping one or two. Universal is not a far drive from Disney so maybe reschedule and keep AOA or AKL. Epic Universe will be packed. You don’t need that much time to do all of Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios, they’re comparatively small. Consider making one of those another Epic Universe day or Magic Kingdom day. Wizarding World within the two is barely even a half day experience, not close to a full. You could nap in the middle of Animal Kingdom day and still get everything done with extended evening hours there. And it will be HOT. Don’t listen to anyone saying otherwise. The week of June 15th will be 90+ every day with humidity that makes it feel 100+. You need to pace yourselves and your rest periods and hydrate liberally or you will be miserable."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:17:49 UTC,3,"Try to substitute some relax/go with the flow days, which might seem odd at WDW, but you’ll easily burn yourself out, and it would take away for all the awesome things you have planned.  Do a resort hopping day 👌🏼"

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:24:57 UTC,3,"With split stays in hotels, it’s better to “move up” than “move down”. All looks okay (regular hotel, AOA, AKL Kidani) until you get to Cabana Bay. Go for Sapphire Falls, Royal Pacific, Hard Rock, or Portofino if you can."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-21 11:37:58 UTC,2,"I've stayed at Pop, AKL, and Cabana Bay before. It would absolutely be disappointing after AKL, and even after Pop. I found the room at CB to be pretty run-down, and it's a big motel-style property.   If you can swing it, look at the Royal Pacific, Portofino Bay, or Hard Rock hotels - they all included unlimited express pass (skip the line) for everyone in the room, from check-in day to check-out day. The rooms are very nice and comfortable, I've stayed at Portofino multiple times, and Royal Pacific once. Both were fantastic, and additionally both had access to free water taxis and walking paths to the parks, with separate security from the main area. If you stay at Cabana Bay, you're either taking a bus, which funnels you through the main security area, walking over to Sapphire Falls to take their water taxi, or taking a ~20 minute walk to CityWalk.  I've also stayed at Aventura, which had very little theming, but I did enjoy my volcano view room."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:23:37 UTC,3,"I haven't seen anyone mention it, but it looks like you only have one day planned for the new park epic universe.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 14:29:06 UTC,3,"There is a lot of good advice here about the itinerary, but as someone who works with many British co workers, please please please promise me that you and your family will drench themselves in sunscreen.   Sunscreen every day. Every part of your skin that could possibly be exposed. And a good hat. Reapplied every two hours."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 15:32:55 UTC,3,"1. You will love Kidani. We stayed there 4 times. And if you are spending “resort-level” money, go for Savannah view. Its great to relax at night on your balcony. They leave the critters out, most of them, all night.  2. Good to plan for rest time. And don’t fret if you hit “the wall” one day and need an extra break. Research some relaxing things to do on “rest” days while everyone else is crowding the parks. There are interesting things to do at Ft. Wilderness on a down day. We liked to get sandwiches at Meadow Trading post for a picnic and just watch the wildlife by the river.  Or rent a little speedboat at one of the Bay Lake resorts. Great fun.  3. Check out NASA or Florida Space Coast website for any space launches during your visit. You can see them from Disney, especially at night. If they still let you, the best view is atop the Contemporary.  4. Go resort-hopping. Especially the monorail resorts. Great views of the water pageant from the Polynesian shoreline."

But more importantly, I hope you all have cooling towels, fans (neck or handheld) and hats with decent ventilation. The heat and humidity will be off the charts. Bring those bottles that can keep things cold for 24hrs.   Edit to add: As most have said, you will need a rest day in-between those Universal parks. If that full day at Wizarding World is a ""walking"" rest day then you should be ok, but a full day there won't be necessary and you need a 2 park ticket to ride the Hogwarts Express"
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 21:36:58 UTC,3,"Save time to check out Disney Springs. It’s free and a nice time to find dinner. You can hop a bus from your Disney resort. Also if you have time while in Epcot, take a short detour to Disney board walk. It’s a short distance from the rear of Epcot, 5 minute walk next to France."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 11:01:10 UTC,4,"This trip looks amazing. I imagine you’ve already done tons of research and know you want to go to BG &amp; SW so I won’t try to dissuade you, all the parks have something different. I love discovery cove! It’s almost like a rest day it’s such a relaxing park. But being able to do DC and go back to try to do Hollywood Studios may be impossible just based on traffic etc. so I personally would just fit HS into one day. I think you could fit all you want to do at Magic kingdom since you have an older child and are active. But I would go on Monday and take advantage of the extra hours and split up your rest days a bit. Looks like a great time and I hope you enjoy it! As a Florida native, just keep in mind anytime you’re moving outside the parks traffic is horrible and it can be at all hours not just rush hour."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 12:52:16 UTC,4,"Everyone saying to take out a day at Busch Gardens or SeaWorld. Those are at least different parks, and will provide a different experience. IMO You do not need five days at universal studios. All of those parks are connected and within the same parks. I can ride just about every ride in one day, maybe a day and a half if I want to ride everything.   I recommend you Take one of those days and do a second day in Margie kingdom. Magic kingdom has a lot packed it and it'll be hard to get everything in in one day. Especially if you've never been there. If you end up getting what you want out of it on day two, you can take a couple hours to rest and have a wary day that day."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:03:46 UTC,2,"On the 17th, after Busch Gardens you will be tired and hot. I would eat dinner in Tampa and take my time. I would hire a car service or rent a car depending on how expensive the Uber is. On the 18th I would sleep in and walk in to HS sometime before noon and just stay there the whole day, instead of splitting HS into two days. You are going to want to rest after discovery cove, the water and sun can be exhausting!  You don’t need a whole day just for the wizarding world of HP.  I don’t know if you have purchased tickets yet, but if you take away 1 day from HS, and 1 day from islands/universal, you might be able to add on some lighting lanes or fast passes to skip lines."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:06:51 UTC,3,"I want to add- make sure to bring sunscreen, a good hat, and ponchos. If you have a hard time with heat consider purchasing personal fans. You can also google average crowds at the parks for each park, (like magic kingdom) and choose a day that is less packed to help plan your trip with breaks accordingly. Love your spreadsheet!"

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:19:29 UTC,2,"Also, I will echo what everyone else has said - sunscreen! We trend toward the reef-safe mineral sunscreen, but you gotta have sunscreen to survive here. Neck-fans and shade breaks are also a must, especially if you aren't used to very hot temps. It is also compounded by the fact that you are walking around on concrete all day, with little wind and shade (though some parks do better than others - AK is usually pretty shady, MK, EPCOT and HS are not). It's not unusual for June-Aug temps to be around 95F (35C) during the day.   Be prepared for afternoon showers as well. It is pretty common to have those in Florida, so take an umbrella if you are going to be out between 2-4pm."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:27:48 UTC,2,"We went for 4 days and I feel like I'm going to die. You couldn't pay me to go in the summer and I'm from a hot climate. Honestly, the most fun I ever had was at Typhoon Lagoon, so I'd do that and skip the Sea World/Bush Gardens, kinda lame. And then use the time to check out some nice beaches or springs."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:29:19 UTC,2,"Prepare your feet! For reference, Buckingham Palace and Hampton Court Palace or St. Pauls Cathedral snd Kew Gardens. The distance between these landmarks approximately 10 - 12 miles. You will be walking this distance EVERY SINGLE PARK DAY."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 13:32:25 UTC,2,"I am from Tampa - grew up going to Busch Gardens and Seaworld and visited Magic Kingdom at 14 for the first time.  As a young adult I married into a Disney loving family and my daughter has grown up as someone with Disney annual passes. As she got older and more adventurous in her ride preferences, we did annual passes at the Universal parks. Shes just a little older than your daughter now.  Ask me anything! :).  My two cents:  Despite feeling like this is a once in a lifetime trip- maybe it is!- remember to rest.  Go back to the hotel and enjoy the pool and maybe some solitude.  It will be very warm and humid in June.  You can always head to the parks, and then come back to the room for a nap or just enjoy the resort, and then head back to the park for the nighttime shows. Sit down restaurants -either at the parks or at the resorts- are also a great way to break up the day and cool off!  I disagree with those saying IOA/UO doesn’t have as much to do as Disney.  Diagon Alley is a small space but has tons to explore. Make sure you find Nocturn Alley, we completely missed it our first trip.  You will not be bored at UO/ IOA especially if your daughter likes roller coasters.  Pro tip for the water rides at IOA: bring a full change of clothing, including shoes, socks, and underwear (or wear flip flops on the ride) and leave it in the locker. You will get completely soaked and be uncomfortable in wet clothes the rest of the day. They’re really fun rides- just be prepared.    PS. I am envious of your day at Epic Universe!  We can’t wait!!!"

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 14:33:33 UTC,2,Having just come back I would say that discovery cove is a full day as it closes at 5.   I would also say that Hollywood studios is 3/4 of a day for the full park. Splitting it into 2 half days is probably not very time efficient when taking getting in and out the park into account.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 15:56:55 UTC,2,"Wow! Looks like a jam packed trip. Things to consider:  I think a few people mentioned ubering from Tampa to Orlando. A bit of a far drive, I would recommend instead of an Uber, looking into a car service to drive you, if renting a car is not possible.   Hollywood Studios can have the potential to be a full day park. I wouldn’t do Discovery Cove with that as it is a far schlep to get there.   While I see you scheduled some rest days, take into consideration your activity levels. Traveling to Orlando in the summer is the equivalent of Dante’s inferno. While you may think you are active you be prepared to stand in long at times hot lines walking at a minimum of 3 miles a day.   Have an awesome time"
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 16:11:16 UTC,2,"Take breaks but you dont need to do it like on Wed 18th.  I would take the skyliner back both days around 12pm-1pm-ish, relax by the pool for 1hr, get new clothes on, then head off to the park for the rest of the day.  Maybe you will be able to do it though because its your only trip but for me it would be way too much especially in the heat that you are not going to be used to."

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 18:24:11 UTC,2,"Everyone has already mentioned sunscreen and the draining Florida weather, but... it's for a reason. I mentioned in another comment to consider those sun-blocking umbrellas, because, *truly*, direct mid-summer Florida sunshine in hot humid weather is *brutal*. And there are times there is no escape. Also, if you miss even the tiniest part of your body with sunscreen, you will know. For days. I recommend the spray-on type as, if nothing else, a secondary coating. Also: hats that cover your ears if you can manage that look or, like me, don't care.  Bring a few pairs of shoes, and bring blister bandages, and if you're even *remotely* prone to blisters, consider proactively applying some bandages to toes that are prone to them. Bad blisters can ruin a week of vacation or more.  Remember: it's gonna be hotter than you expect, no matter what you expect, and you'll walk more than you expect, no matter what you expect.  For the agenda:  I'm just going to assume that you're going to go to all four places. If it were me, though, and it were possible, at least one of which is definitely not the case, I'd consider passing on at least one of those, and, for me, it'd be either Seaworld (because, trust me, you're not going to want to leave WDW for that, even though the SW rides are pretty good, because... it's just a lot of time away from a *better* place) or Busch Gardens (because flying to/from Orlando saves a lot of hassle, and, again, both WDW and Universal are better parks). Since your tickets are probably locked in place, I'd *personally* drop SeaWorld, but power to you if you can handle all of it.  Second, if it is at *all* possible to add Park Hopper - assuming it doesn't come with your tickets - I'd do it. It's nice, especially being able to go between Epcot's back entrance and Hollywood Studios. Sometimes, the park you pick just isn't feeling right for you that day, and it's nice to have options.  Third, Kidani, and AKL in general, blows AoA out of the water. AoA is nice. AKL, and especially Jambo's main lobby, is an entirely different level. If possible - and obviously I don't know your budget or what you can change - I'd strongly push for more time at AKL *or* see if you can rent Disney Vacation Club (DVC) points and, instead of AoA, stay at Beach Club or Boardwalk. Added bonus is that non-studio DVC rooms come with laundry and full kitchens.  You seem like you might be a bit of a roller coaster junkie, in which case WDW is probably the *least* thrilling place (although in many other ways, the rides there are amazing). But, given that Universal has good rides too... *maybe* see if you can do only WDW and Universal and at least get a *bit* more out of the 14 day passes you're getting for each.  Just throwing it out there because, hey, it's the WDW subreddit, but...  How about staying the whole time at WDW, skipping Busch and SW,  commuting on Universal on those days, and buying the Universal tickets once here, so you don't need to get two weeks of tickets? I am telling you... once you get into a high-end WDW resort, you won't want to leave.  I had to a least say it. I'm sure you're gonna love your itinerary, though!"
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-20 18:40:29 UTC,2,"I don’t know anything about the other, but I personally wouldn’t split the Hollywood studios day. I’d do morning, rest, go back late afternoon.

,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-21 04:01:35 UTC,2,"I would do less moving hotels. You’ve got a slam packed itinerary and you’re going to hit the wall at some point and everyone will be exhausted and turn on each other.   Universal is not worth 6 days. Buy their express pass and cut that time significantly.   I would not split Hollywood Studios across days like that. Each day in a park, make it to rope drop, have an optimized touring plan, get most of your rides done by lunch. As the crowds hit their peak, go back to the room, hit the pool, take a short nap and then go back to the park after the crowds start diminishing. Finish touring until gate close."
,comment,USA,Florida,2024-10-21 13:46:35 UTC,2,"Great job scheduling hotel rest! So many people overdo it in one day and burn out. I get why some might suggest not splitting up Studios into two days due to travel time, but I think your plan makes sense. Just be mindful of the Florida summer heat. Even as a lifelong Floridian (40 years) and Disney annual passholder, I got heat exhaustion there when we went this last September.  If no one in your group is really into roller coasters or zoo-style attractions, you might want to skip Busch Gardens, SeaWorld, and/or Discovery Cove. That way, you can explore Disney and Universal at a slower pace. I'd also suggest building in more mid-day breaks. It might feel like you're losing time with transportation, but between 11 am and 4 pm, it's the hottest part of the day. Taking a break to rest, shower, and rehydrate at the resort can really help, and you'll still have time to enjoy the parks in the cooler evenings. For example, you could check into AoA early, enjoy EPCOT in the evening, and then break the next day into two parts: EPCOT until late morning, a break, then back to EPCOT after 4 pm."

,comment,USA,Houston,2025-03-07 16:42:27 UTC,2,"I like doing places that have something special or that make it easy to share the meal, so with that in mind, the places that I like to hit are:  Lucy (getting the sampler plate is a good choice to try different things)   Happy Lamb (hasn't been the same since the rebranding, but it's still a solid experience, specially if you haven't had hot pot before, other good options are XiaoLongKan and Chiba Hot Pot)   Xochi (I really enjoy their Sunday buffet, although not the cheapest, another great option would be La Guadalupana, which is more of a hole in the wall kind of place)   Vietnamese food in general, my main place closed down and I haven't found a new place, so I would just say go with whatever you like best.  Golden Dim Sum or Dim Sum King (I think both are equally great and it's fun to other a lot of different things to try)   Korea House (this is my favorite KBBQ, however, there are plenty of other good places, some that are a bit cheaper too, like Gen Korean BBQ lunch prices are pretty good)   The original La Calle on Franklin (has my favorite tacos in town with good drinks, but there are a few other options too like Frontera)   Harry's (this is one of my favorite brunch spots, although it usually has quite a wait, another option for breakfast is Black Bear Dinner, love that place!)"

We did lots of eating, drinking, art museums, went to a ball game, some shopping, looked at street art. All of which can be done in Houston but Chicago is better looking and it's easier to get around, which I think is why Houston feels less appealing. Before moving to Houston I described it as ugly Chicago but have found over time that Houston isn't stunning but it's better looking than I thought."

That whole hotel has an interesting rich Texas history. I also learned about the brothels that used to be in San Antonio and the historic figures who would frequent them.

,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 05:32:23 UTC,21,"Having soul crushing weather is the biggest challenge to tourism. NYC has shit spread all over, but not having 95°, 95% humidity days makes it more bearable to walk or Uber 3-4 miles to go see something."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 11:23:06 UTC,37,"No way you’re comparing the spread of NYC to Houston. In NYC you have a whole bunch to do in just a few blocks and you can just get on a subway an go to a different borough like nothing. Houston is broken up by freeways, you can’t walk more than a few blocks without hitting freeways or roadways that are simply to dangerous to cross on foot. Even the inner loop neighborhoods aren’t that easy to get to one to another. We also have a downtown that’s basically a ghost town outside working hours.   I’m not saying we need to become NYC or Chicago or something but let’s be real: our extreme car-centric design and lack of population density hurts the development of the city. There’s a reason we are the 4th largest city yet have very little national presence, you just don’t get a vibrant city culture out of freeways and parking lots."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 15:41:56 UTC,9,The lack of density is also why Houston isn't as psycho expensive as NYC.

,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 00:05:28 UTC,58,"Every town, even those in the middle of nowhere, will have “tourist attractions”. Some places have a giant ball of yarn, or a funky stone, or some crap like that. Having attractions doesn’t necessarily mean they will be interesting enough to attract tourists  As someone who has: (1) traveled a lot (2) travels as part of my job and (3) knows other people that travel frequently, Houston is very much a hard pass for most tourists. I was in NYC recently for work and my team was talking about how great it is that we all live in different parts of the country, and can show others around when the team co-locates together. We have co-located in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, and NYC. We were trying to think about where to co-locate next, when my home city of Houston was brought up. I shit you not, the senior manager on my team said “no offense consultinglove, we aren’t going there, there’s nothing in Houston.” And compared to other cities in the country, I agree"
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 17:57:50 UTC,3,"I believe it. I’m a former New Yorker who has lived in Houston for 40 years. For tourists, the lack of easy public transport to our main attractions is a huge negative. Add to that the incredible heat from May through early November, and the deadness of our downtown area on weekends. Bars close early compared to NY, NOLA, LV. If you live here, and basically go from car to job or living room most days, it’s perfectly fine though."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 00:26:31 UTC,12,"As someone who travels a lot, knows a number of travelers, and who has hosted a number of travelers, i know that it depends on the circle of people you talk to.   The only way you're going to find tourists in Houston is to talk to tourists **IN** Houston."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 00:53:07 UTC,10,"Doesnt really  make any sense that a national company would want to meet up in a more explicit tourist city anyway, unless the company just like burning money.  My company has EVERY interstate company gathering in Houston.  It even happens when few to none of the participants are based here .... getting San Francisco and NYC execs together here is still better for the bottom line than either of those cities.   Buisness tourism is a little different than leisure, not the same considerations.  That being said I try to find something special to recommend.  Our San Francisco contingent is largely vegan, and everyone has to eat,  so we hit up all the vegan soul food places for them.  Not uniquely H-town maybe, but still regionally exotic for them."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 00:37:39 UTC,20,What about tourists not in Houston? Your logic fails instantly.  On average Houston gets 22M visitors per year compared to over 70M in NYC.   I don’t need to talk to tourists in Houston to know that the city has trash attractions compared to other cities
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 00:52:56 UTC,1,"&gt;What about tourists not in Houston? Your logic fails instantly. &gt;   As does yours.  Your looking for people in other areas and wondering if they **WOULD** go to Texas isn't an accurate way to find them especially with the token poll you're taking.   Talk to the tourists that are in Houston and see why they're actually here instead of a theoretical poll on IF they'd visit Houston.   There are far too many variables individually as to what they're interests are.   I actually knew someone that flew to Houston from Germany to see Billy idol preform at numbers a decade ago.   There are multiple reasons people come to Houston that may not appeal to you, but does appeal to them."

,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 04:01:38 UTC,29,"Agree with many of the comments here.  Houston doesn’t quite have the same sizzle and organization that makes it a memorable and convenient visit.  43, and have lived here about 35 of my years ….  To give a slightly different take tho, one that’s more charitable: my family is from India originally, and so we have had many family members and friends visit us over the years.  My dad loved taking them around and showing them places.  And they generally loved it.  They loved eating fajitas and trying margs at Ninfas, Goode Co., and Chinese food off Bellaire.  Taste of Texas.  One of the city’s best aspects is the food scene.    (When I worked near DC for a few years in my mid 30s, I remarked to a work acquaintance that I found the multi-cultural food scene there a tad overblown, and they defensively shot back at me about what would I know being from Texas, and man I lit his ass up!)  We definitely did the trip to NASA more times than I’d like to remember.  Depending on who and how long they were staying, we might take them to San Antonio and/or Austin for a weekend.   My folks are museum lovers, and so lots of family trips and trips with out of town visitors to the MFAH.  Which btw is a real gem, and I’ve always felt like more people my age don’t value it for what it is.  When my gradfather became a widower, he came from India to stay with us for a few months.  He made his career out of managing tea plantations in rural India, and in the same spirit of adventure he enjoyed a lifelong love for cowboy novels and movies.  Louis L’Amour.  John Wayne.  Man oh man, did he love visiting the Alamo during a trip to SATX and getting himself a pair of cowboy boots.  All of which is to say that you all are right, but I really love this place now as an adult even though I know I took it for granted for a very long time.  And sure, I wish we had a legit four season climate, and I definitely get pangs when I travel anywhere that isn’t flat.  But yeah, you kinda have to be from here to really love it.  One last thing:  the Anthony Bourdain episode on Houston was really beautiful and it made my heart feel very full to hear someone as travelled as him wax poetic about the charms of our city."

Plus those parts of town would develop as ""hubs"" for restaurants and bars or whatever, each with its own distinct personality.  I think locals would take advantage of the rail as well to avoid driving drunk or even just to get downtown or uptown to work or shop."

Strong dining, museums, performing and visual arts, shopping, professional sports, etc. The cityscape isn’t particularly friendly for visitors (or residents) but that’s a different discussion. I don’t think many people are passing on Houston because it doesn’t have enough tourist attractions."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-19 23:03:12 UTC,13,"&gt;The cityscape isn’t particularly friendly for visitors (or residents) but that’s a different discussion.  Is it, though?  I think part of the appeal of other cities I've visited or lived in is that there are hotels located near to many attractions, and getting around is a lot easier.  They have neighborhoods bustling with activity where you can easily keep yourself entertained on foot and without any itinerary for a few days.  The places I've visited where having a car is as important as it is in Houston have all had a nature appeal to them (i.e. national/state parks, natural features, etc) that we do not.       I think the person who said it works for people coming for concerts, festivals, conferences, etc. nailed it.  One can have a decent time staying downtown for those events and then taking the light rail into the Museum District or NRG stadium, but I don't see that many people choosing Houston over another destination if they aren't already going to be here for some occasion.     I'm not sure much can be done about this overnight, but as the city grows and develops hopefully it will be more ""contiguous"" in terms of where a person can spend time as a tourist and where they stay, but because of the sprawl, car culture, no zoning, and the weather I think it will happen more slowly than it could otherwise."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 04:10:04 UTC,5,"&gt;Strong dining, museums, performing and visual arts, shopping, professional sports, etc  These are pretty much the strengths of any major city in the US. you don't need to go to Houston to get those. The attractive cities supplement those things with unique high-appeal attractions or natural/architectural beauty. Houston has neither."
,comment,USA,Houston,2022-12-20 08:57:29 UTC,2,"i think the crux of the matter is that there is a difference between tourism and visitation.  if you're flying here to spend time doing something, then thats different to flying in to a city just to experience it.  anchorage alaska is *much* more of a tourist city than houston, even though technically speaking houston blows anchorage out of the water."

Be PROUD of your disgusting ugly city that is by all accounts not that tourist friendly when compared to NYC, New Orleans, Austin, Chicago, Seattle, or even LA (better than Dallas though!)  &amp;#x200B;  Houston is great for a long weekend. So many restaurants and bars and breweries, also great museums, cool parks, and also cool little interesting places like Orange Show or Lucky Land or the flea market next to it.  Also Montrose/Rice Village/Heights/Midtown/East Side are walkable enough (or at least parts of them are) to do a little neighborhood shopping and exploring. Don't forget about Galveston right down the road. Plus you can go to Astros/Rockets game if you want depending on the time of year, and don't forget the cool concerts and festivals that come through (not to mention local bands). I could easily make an itinerary of stuff to do for 4-5 days, and then you could also drive to other small towns nearby like San Leon or even Nacogdoches. Rural East Texas (and especially Deep East Texas) is always an interesting place to explore and take a road trip through, especially for people from out of state. Also even though there aren't too many hikes in Houston, there are a few national forests or state forests nearby to check out or go camping at.  BUT all this said -- the only catch is you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time in a car. Also, I don't think Houston would be a great place to visit if you didn't have a host who knew what they were doing. Just showing up and expecting to be entertained easily without knowning anyone is a tough ask.

You can go from An anime pop up to a sports game, to a concert at Last Concert, head over to Chinatown for for some food, go to Rooftop cinema or Miller outdoor theater for date night. The yearly schedule doesn't change, you just have to know what and when. The rodeo/Cook off in Feb. March crawfish season starts...TX2K...IYKYK.  April-July pops ups start, galleries, breweries, pools, water parks, conventions, Now also remember Austin, San Antonio, Dallas are only a Few hours away so add...Fiesta, Sxsw, Marley Fest, six flags, the river walk,  the state fair, , the rivers out in San Marco/New Braunfels, ACL. Houston definitely it's a touristy place, so that in itself doesn't make ppl come here and the weather of course. IIt used to bother me when people would say that there's nothing to do here.

This area is very walkable and can be reached via light trail. There are several other smaller museums depending on your interests.

It's a huge interconnected trail system that has different parking and access spots. You can primitive camp out there too.  Even at the more popular trails (Kirby and the carnivorous plant trail), there usually aren't very many people. If you go on the more isolated trails, you probably won't encounter anyone at all.   We do ten to twelve mile hikes out there a couple times a month and have a blast. There aren't any mosquitos right now (too dry, now too cold?), some of the trails have quite a bit of elevation change for SETX, and the scenery is usually pretty. Lots of wildlife too. We were going at night because of how hot it is over the summer, and if you go around sunset, there're animals EVERYWHERE right on the trails."

I get there early, stay for a while, then drive back home before 5:00 pm traffic. Or Bear Creek Park. Not the one with the soccer fields, the other one. Bring a hammock, a doobie, if that's your thing. And hang out for a while."

Killed an hour or two, depending on traffic, and got my mind off things, because I enjoy driving and listening to music. Now I drive for a living and that drive sucks, even in light traffic. I did do the beltway loop a few times, before the tolls were ridiculous. I'm going to have to try the Grand Parkway one of these days, I think."

I only had one day, I was just passing through so I couldn't see much but it was fun!  Rock City is a must see, the caves, viewing platforms and gardens are stunning. I went to one of the animal shows and it was so cool! I found Lookout Mountain completely by accident missing my turn, amazing scenic drive.

There is an adorable little museum downtown about tow trucks, because Chattanooga is the birthplace of the tow truck.   As other folks have mentioned, definitely check out the Aquariums the next time you get to visit.   Also, Chattanooga is the United States first National Park City.

,comment,USA,Chicago; New Orleans; Oregon; United States,2024-01-18 20:41:59 UTC,22,Hello!  I was born and raised in Maine.   Best place on earth.  I recommend July and August.  June can still be chilly.   But less crowded.   A perfect place to start is Portland.   Amazing food.  Best restaurants.   Lobster for days. Travel up the coast.  Kennebunkport.(south of Portland) Rockport Camden and bar harbor.   Picturesque.  Postcard.   While in Portland so much to do and see.   Go out to get your own lobster with. Lobsterman off of commercial street and Portland lobster go will cook them for you to eat.    Ahhhh makes me miss Maine and summer. ❤️ 🦞

,comment,USA,Chicago; New Orleans; Oregon; United States,2024-01-18 22:38:35 UTC,5,"If you go to Maine (and you should) definitely go to Cabbage Island Clambakes. They run out of Boothbay Harbor. We went there in August and - OMG - even in the driving rain it was awesome! They take you and about 40 others on a boat to a private island, then you FEAST!  Two lobsters, steamers (steamed clams), boiled egg, baked potato baked onion, fish chowder, ear of corn, blueberry cake and coffee. There's also a cash bar. The island is only about 2 acres and you have free time to walk all around and explore. It's about $70 per person and you have to reserve it like a month in advance. We were in New England for 2 weeks and it was one of the highlights of our trip."
,comment,USA,Chicago; New Orleans; Oregon; United States,2024-01-18 20:57:01 UTC,5,"I went for a week for work related travel, but made as much of it as I could! I traveled at the very beginning of September and it was already starting to get a bit chilly but still good weather.   I stayed in Bangor in a hotel but get an airbnb or rental if you can. The city is a friendly little New England town. If you're planning for Acadia though, you might prefer to stay closer to actual Bar Harbor. I personally wouldn't have wanted to stay in Bar Harbor proper because it is a tourist destination which brought with it quite a few stereotypical bus groups and the like. Belfast also was really enjoyable, on the water and friendly people.   When you inevitably visit Bar Harbor/Acadia, you should take the little walk over Bar Island ""land bridge"" to do a little nature walk on tiny Bar Island. Its really cool because it is only accessible during low tides - I went right as the tide was rising so I couldn't stay long unless I wanted to be stuck for the night.   On my drive back from Bar Harbor to Bangor, I stopped in Trenton at Downeast Lobster Pound for fresh lobster and 100% recommend it to anyone who wants a more authentic Maine Lobster experience rather than the overpriced tourist traps in Bar Harbor.   I don't have a lot of recommendations about the rest of the state but would love to go back one day to explore more inland. Hopefully this all helps, it's been 5 years since I went so I'm trying to give as much advice as I can from memory!"

,comment,USA,Chicago; New Orleans; Oregon; United States,2024-01-19 13:37:41 UTC,2,"I'd highly recommend a fall (early October) road trip through New England while you're there. The whole vibe is just so different from the West Coast. Great fall color and lots of ado - hayrides and harvest fests and craft fairs. V. wholesome Americana.   On the coast, eat lots of seafood. Further inland, it's pie time."

Due to the proximity, we *had* to visit Maine for some lobster rolls and damn if they were better (obviously) than anything I can get in the US SW. Best I've had for sure.  Unfortunately we didn't stay overnight in Maine, just the day trip for the lunch. But I have some great pictures of the Portland Head Light and the Atlantic that are still my phone background ~8 years later!"

The architecture, food, music, the city is so vibrant.  If you like nature, yes ABSOLUTELY go to Oregon. It's so close! Bend is one of my all time favorite cities.

We always go in the winter to avoid the heat, humidity and smells.   It is like visiting another country.   We’ve grown to love the locals and their attitudes (they are out of fucks to give). We stay away from Bourbon Street and parade crowds and usually get a hotel in the Warehouse District.   2-3 days is perfect.  The food is incredible- we usually eat half our meals at our favorite places and the other half at new places we discover (walking or cab/Uber)."

Very peaceful, and most folks don’t realize the vastness of the Lake. Feels like you’re on an ocean. People even surf on it.  Agree on Chicago. The architecture, music, food is all great. And on another massive Great Lake."

,comment,USA,Chicago; New Orleans; Oregon; United States,2024-01-18 21:02:02 UTC,9,"Here’s some of my personal favorites:  New Orleans - absolutely amazing food and so much fun! Plus so much history! Amazing for music lovers as there are bands playing at pretty much every bar  Las Vegas - Yes, I know this isn’t for everyone. If you research you can have an amazing trip here full of great food, interesting spots and and a lot to do in nature! Just go prepared if you’re venturing into nature  San Francisco and the Bay Area - it’s popular to shit on this area right now but I think it’s such a unique place. I’m not sure where you’re from in CA but if you haven’t explored the Bay Area and some nearby places (Santa Cruz, Monterrey) you’re missing out  Portland, OR - a small city that’s still a lot of fun. The natural beauty in this area is astounding and the coast isn’t far away at all. Lots of good food and even more good beer. Give Willamette Valley Vineyards a try.  I’m from the east coast and I can say most east coast places are pretty meh. South Florida is crazy and fun to visit just to see it, same thing for Texas. NYC is probably a bucket list place as well."

There are some nice beaches along the SC coast, too.  (Stay below Myrtle Beach, though.)  If you opt for this location, do not visit from about June to mid-October, though.

You mentioned Oregon, &amp; it was stunning!  We flew into Portland, drove by Mount Hood to Bend, and then to Crater Lake.  We then dipped down into northern CA &amp; went to Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park before driving up the entire OR coast.  From there, we went to Mount Ranier, then Seattle, &amp; then on an Alaskan cruise, &amp; I am definitely looking forward to returning to the PNW again one day!  You also mentioned New Orleans, &amp; it's a very cool city too, &amp; I've always really enjoyed my time there!  And one of my favorite cities is Key West, so I've got to throw that in, too!  Oh, &amp; the SW is nice as well!  We enjoyed Phoenix &amp; Scottsdale, then on to Flagstaff &amp; the Grand Canyon, &amp; don't miss Sedona &amp; the red rocks!  Sante Fe was great, too!

Stayed a few days in San Francisco before taking rhe golden gate to highway 1 all the way north. The redwood forest is really cool and we drove our car literally through one of the trees. Crater Lake was the most breathtaking sight I have ever witnessed. It was during covid and the national park was nearly empty- we slept in our SUV along one of the rims overlooking the lake. On the drive back we hit Twin Falls, Idaho before car camping in Yellowstone and Grand Teton. We planned our departure to get to Mt. Rushmore around midnight to see the faces all lit up.

40,post,USA,,2023-05-14 20:36:59 UTC,10982,"What I like and dislike about the USA.... as a tourist. I have been touring the United States for several weeks now, visiting multiple states. I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.  This is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.  I'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.  I am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.  Thinks I like  * Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA. * People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude. * Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one. * Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe. * The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.  Things I don't like  * Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises. * The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe. * Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels. * Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?  So here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe."
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 20:51:13 UTC,1793,I'm South Asian and I live in the Netherlands now. I had no idea asking to pack up leftovers was weird. In the restaurants I've been to (South Asian ones) they've always packed it up for free! Learnt something new today :)

My mom pays and this poor old confused lady thought it was her stuff so she starts put them in a bag and I talk to her like she has dementia:   Oh no sorry Madame I think you accidentally started packing our stuff with yours. Don't worry it happens. She looked at me.like I was crazy and continued, then it dawned on me. US. Seniors pack your groceries. And my mom laughed at me the whole way home"

I'm so jealous of the magnificent nature you have in your country, I saw so many beautiful sights! Please treasure it. I disagree with the low quality food, I had both really good meals and really poor ones. Best Thai food I ever had was in LA. Also, so many places sell drip coffee just the way I like it, not some watered down espressos. Loved that! Another like were the many (mostly) clean and free restrooms, Having to pay for using a dirty restroom in a rest area along the highway in Europe sucks. That being said, some restrooms in the US really didn't care about my privacy with one inch gaps everywhere. Driving was so convenient, being a pedestrian not so much. I biked through SF but couldn't say I felt very safe.  Dislikes were the tipping culture and prices listed pre-tax. I mean, I ordered food or drinks to go a couple of times where I often had to tip in advance only for something to go wrong with my order. Not getting my tip back am I?  Overall I had a great time, met a lot of friendly people and saw amazing nature and wildlife. I can't wait to go back!"

I remember asking for a glass of tap water and the waiter literally said no, that if I wanted water I would have to buy a drink and he'll give it to me, or I'd have to buy a (plastic) bottle of water. I said well, no worries then, as I had a Nalgene with me.  When he saw me drinking from it he showed up again and said he'd have to ask me to leave if I kept drinking from my water bottle.   Like, yikes. I couldn't help but ask for a little more of an explanation and he was just like ""If we gave free water to everyone we'd be out of business."" It kind of took everything in me not to be a ""well in my country"" type of person and mention that every restaurant in the entire USA, big or small, fancy or not, will put a glass of water in front of you without you even asking for it.  Honestly, I just didn't want to drink anything other than water and I didn't want to buy water in a plastic bottle.  Plus the bill was over a thousand euros in the end. Just seemed like a wild hill to die on, but then again I'm the one still dying on it after all this time."

It was really weird… we didn’t even vote for him. Imagine just going up to a random Brit and being like “hey what about that Brexit thing, huh?” or “hm, them trifling Tories, know what I mean?” without saying hello or anything. But like you said, non-Americans are more aware of American politics than the other way around and I guess these interactions are just a symptom of it.   But yeah, I also went to France in December and I had similar gripes. Americans are spoiled in that most of our businesses will accommodate our wants and specific tastes, especially in restaurants.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experiences, but I found many Europeans (not stereotyping - I said “many”) convinced in their opinions of the USA—a place most had only seen on TV or in movies. Their understanding was rarely deeper than common tropes, but spoken with absolute certainty. On multiple occasions I was confronted by total strangers who berated me for slavery existing in the United States in the 19th century, or people who wanted to pick a fight about the price of university in the USA (when I told them that I was hired by the European Space Agency at the age of 26 to run ESA’s first long-duration astronaut mission to the ISS, their tune changed).   These interactions were regular and fairly exhausting.

That said, racism in these parts of the world feels more discriminatory than flat-out hate crime.

Racism exists everywhere. That is without a doubt. However, racism in other countries is… not _typically_ dangerous. It is just as harmful socially, and is despicable anywhere. But there are certain parts of the US where racism can turn to violence in a hurry. I think people miss that. There is a culture of violence and self-centered behavior that has a unique flavor here that can often be based in racism."

This was in Berlin. It really shocked me because I didn't expect that in the area I was in because it's more international and full of hipsters. It can really happen anywhere. I actually was pretty shocked by how racist Berlin can be. Only place I got yelled at for not speaking the local language and this was when I first visited. The lady was triggered that I spoke English.  Racism in Europe is still pretty systemic as well. For example, a landlord admitted in an interview in Berlin that he doesn't rent to Asian people because they cook weird food and bring in insects. I've heard Europeans say comments like this to me, in my face, without even thinking of how weird or fucked up it sounds. I think it was shocking for me as someone who grew up in a very liberal area where people always talk about how progressive Europe is.   I do think the US has guns though which can get so scary, really fast if someone is violently racist. Like that Korean family in Texas who literally had three family members die in one shooting and now a six year old has no parents or a brother."

Also, I found the variety of food in Europe to be lacking compared to the US, especially when outside of the biggest cities. Just from the perspective of a south asian person who grew up in the south and now lives in California so I'm sort of used to good international cuisine variety. The variety of food in Europe from what I've experienced is sometimes worse than the Alabama city that I grew up in. I get a bit bored of most European cuisines after a week and feel like it gets bland for my tastes.

I work across the entire country, and amazing food can be found even in mid-sized towns in fly-over parts of the country. There are things I've eaten in Lafayette, LA, Lawrence, KS, Savannah, GA, etc., that would stack up with food I've eaten anywhere.   There are foodies everywhere. There are great farm-to-table restaurants across the South and Midwest. From southern soul food, BBQ, Cajun, Creole, etc., there are cuisines we have in the US that aren't done as well elsewhere. Large cities aren't the only places with great food in the US."

,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 21:55:26 UTC,463,"Pretty sure OP just chose some mediocre places. The disliking of food here made me chuckle. No, we are not just burgers and hot dogs lol. If you’re in a big city in the US, there tends to be a variety of cuisines (Korean, Mexican, Peruvian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) I’m in Southern California and I know that I will be missing the food here if I ever leave. The breakfast comment as well made me smirk. I like my eggs and omelettes and pancakes. Breakfast in Europe for me is underwhelming (not that anyone should care). OP, you can’t be expecting a European style breakfast in the US. But I will wholeheartedly agree, our cheese is nothing like you’ll find from where you’re from. Just the way we’re raised and what foods we’re used to I suppose. As an American, I wouldn’t think it necessary or that people want to know that I don’t like breakfast in the Netherlands (or any other country)."

,comment,USA,France; Ireland; Netherlands,2023-05-14 23:07:56 UTC,90,"I agree. I am in Europe quite a bit and if you judge the food from hotels it will seem like they eat nothing but pastries and yogurt and jam.   Also, you can't get really good Mexican food anywhere that I have found in Europe. In general, they don't eat spicy food except for maybe some curry. They consider that picante oil for pizza as 'explosive' when by southwestern standards it has no flavor at all.  As a traveler, I know I tend to try to find quick things to eat like from a boulangerie or Tesco Express. This is because if I ate what I really wanted every meal (or even once a day) I wouldn't be able to afford traveling as often as I do. So I eat a lot of pizza and chocolate croissants and bananas in Europe.    Cheese --- most of the cheese I eat is from Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. Maybe it depends where you shop.   Better in Europe:  The roundabouts. OMG they save so much time and gas.   Going into a restaurant or cafe with the entire purpose being to sit, relax, eat, take your time and enjoy yourself.    So many castles, everywhere.   Not having to tip.  There are almost always vegetarian and vegan options on menus.  But most importantly, the ability to relax when you don't have to worry about mass shootings. It's such a strange feeling."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 23:09:02 UTC,62,The food criticism was accurate until maybe 20 years ago. Then you had a real food renaissance in the States largely centered around ethnic food. Food and craft beer are probably the two areas where the U.S. has improved a ton recently.
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:32:59 UTC,48,"Right! Like the compliant about fresh food, and cheese are the ones that confuse me the most.   While yes, there are places in the States that are food desserts, you can find fresh produce at any grocery store. Where I live we have a mix of high end(Whole Foods), major chains(Safeway, Harris Teeter), Specialty(Aldi, Trader Joe’s), and local markets. You can even find fresh produce at Walmart or Target.  American Cheese blows me even more. Like we are one of the largest producers of cheese in the World. Velvetta and cheese wiz are not the only cheese available."

,comment,USA,London,2023-05-14 21:57:18 UTC,66,"In my experience it’s even worse in Europe. Very rigid structures in companies, all based on age/length of employment and also your qualifications. Basically impossible for someone young and ambitious to rise up quickly in a company or be successful. Hence why so many French people for example would move to London.   The USA admires that hard work and success attitude, but in many ways it’s also bad. Try getting a decent job without a degree, or if you have bad credit or a criminal record. And there is the attitude that if you are poor or not successful then it’s your own fault for not being smart or working hard enough."
,comment,USA,France; Italy,2023-05-14 22:04:22 UTC,44,"That's fair, it's not all good. The fetishisation of the hard-working hyper-qualified go-getter as the ideal American probably isn't healthy! But it's also difficult to get a job as an ex-convict in other countries. And we definitely have the 'deserving poor' stereotype in other Anglo countries. Arguably the yanks got it from us in the first place (Puritans).  I also agree that mainland Europe is so much worse in this regard. The amount of red tape faced in places like France and Italy is shocking. It mostly seems designed to preserve the positions of existing companies and employees at the expense of literally everyone else in society."

The treatment of indigenous history is a huge one between NZ and the US, I know NZ isn't perfect but whoah boyyy is it better than the US. Learned more about the Māori in one month living here than I did about the indigenous Americans in 30 years living in the US.  Curious where you are living in the US though.

,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 23:36:52 UTC,13,"Were your indigenous populations destroyed the way that American ones were?

,comment,USA,Mexico,2023-05-14 22:14:31 UTC,20,"&gt;	quality produce at a reasonable price  Depends on where you are. When I lived in the Upper Midwest produce was much more expensive and usually pretty mediocre compared to living in Arizona. So much cheaper and better here because we’re close to where it comes from (primarily California and Mexico).  &gt;tipping  Couldn’t agree more and it’s only gotten worse in recent years. I really hope tipping culture dies at some point. Nothing against gratuity for good service (over and above) but right now we’re subsidizing employee wages and that’s just wrong. Waiters and waitresses should be paid a decent wage given the price of restaurant food these days."
,comment,USA,France; Paris,2023-05-14 21:30:46 UTC,123,"If you would like to learn why and how tipping culture came to the US and how it has evolved over time, I highly recommend [this throughline podcast](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/29/1089587173/the-land-of-the-fee-2021)  I just got back from France yesterday and it was the first time I’ve been to Europe since pre Covid. Before Covid a lot of places didn’t even do food “to-go”. That seems to have changed.   I do love having fresh baked bread and cheese for breakfast. Yogurt is also much better in Europe, I don’t know how the us sucks so hard at yogurt. It really is terrible here. I also can’t drink American orange juice anymore since having OJ in Europe.   I just got back from France where we rented a car and drove in Paris. I could not believe how hard it was to see the stop lights, but thought they were in that position to help drivers see pedestrians- that is a really big problem in the Us, not sure how big of an issue it is in the EU.   Something else that I often notice- accessibility in Europe really, really sucks. I know that retrofitting old buildings is really tricky and there’s limited space, but every time I go I feel so bad for people who require mobility devices."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-15 00:34:13 UTC,17,"Agree on yogurt and OJ, but what really got me (as an American visiting Europe) was tomatoes. I had no idea tomatoes could taste that amazing. Our hotbox, year round, ship everywhere tomatoes are garbage."
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 22:50:12 UTC,23,"Yes, the traffic lights being close up are to prevent cars from driving over the pedestrian crosswalks.

SO MANY pedestrians are killed in the US because of motor vehicles and our public transportation/walking infrastructure is HORRENDOUS.

In the US they are dry and not good, hence nobody likes scones until they go to England.   The cars in Europe...when you come home you realize how idiotic it is that we drive such big cars, and their cars get such better mileage.  Accessibility - I hope I am never disabled because traveling in airports anywhere would be such a pain in the ass. That's what I noticed a lot on this last trip. Being in a wheelchair would just be so hard. Using the Metro/Underground etc. would also be a nightmare since most stations aren't step-free."
,comment,USA,Germany,2023-05-14 22:40:41 UTC,72,"Having lived in both for two years, here's my take on both. In Europe I lived in Germany, but travelled around the neighboring countries a bit and now I live in VA. I'm also speaking as a student with limited income lol. I'm mostly writing about what I like, as it what I dislike contrasts pretty well with the other (i.e what I love about Europe I grow to appreciate even more in relation to my time in the US, and vice versa).  Europe Love -Public transport, bikes and walking. I don't have a car, but that was never a problem in Europe. I could get anywhere I wanted to pretty feasibly and in good time.  -Healthier food options. I felt so energized my whole time living there, and when I come back, because I feel like I'm eating simpler and healthier most days. I'm Southeast Asian, so it did take a while before I got used to simple foods (like cold cuts, cheese and bread for meals), but I do miss eating that minimally every now and then.  -Prices. Now, it might just be where I live in both, but I found Europe a lot more affordable than the US. Granted, I only had to worry about buying food and going out, but still, I find myself a lot more conscious about my spending when I was in the US.   -Safety. I felt a lot safer in Europe than the US. As a student in both, gun violence is one difference, yeah, but even then in cities in Europe I felt that there were always all sorts of people (especially women and the elderly) around even in the early morning by themselves, which made me feel that if locals thought it was safe, then I felt safer. Whereas in the US, in large cities, I often have locals warn me about certain areas, especially at night. Fortunately I've never had incidents in either country, but still.  -LGBT life. Speaking as a gay person, Europe has more options. I feel safe in most places in both, especially with friends around, but I feel that European cities had more diverse and um... Liberated venues, so to speak. Which I'm a fan of.   US: -Friendly and open people. I actually think the Europe I saw was very friendly! But people in the US are next level friendly, and as an outgoing person myself, I really do enjoy that about being in the US. I often chat with people at stores, bars, in rideshares and around my college campus too, which I didn't get to experience as much in Europe (though that might also be the language barrier at play).  -More food diversity. I lived in two cities of comparable size in both, and even in other cities that are similarly large, I just think the US' history of migration has led it to evolve such a rich and diverse food culture. There're so many options for dining places. Again, not to say Europe didn't have options, but the US just has a lot more places that are also a lot more mixed at an accessible level. Tipping still sucks though, but I still make sure to tip as well as I could. Just because I disagree with the conditions that led to tipping doesn't give me the right to screw over my server.   -Speaking of diversity, the US definitely feels more diverse as a whole, even outside of large cities. I get along with most people, but there's a quicker level of connection I'm able to get with US PoC for some reason that I didn't feel as much in Europe.  Even though I have more things listed that I like in Europe, I really do enjoy both for their own merits! Didn't expect my comment to be this long though"
,comment,USA,Holland; Nice,2023-05-14 23:01:31 UTC,25,"Nice to get your perspective. Considering the reputation Holland has for being, well, ahem… “money focused” let’s say, it’s really surprising to me that the Dutch aren’t asking for to-go boxes for every scrap of food they don’t finish during a meal.   Enjoyed your notes and it’s nice to see a post that is not looking to just stir the pot.   I will offer one criticism: it’s almost impossible to categorically define American food. It is true that a lot of it is absolutely packed with sugar and is highly processed. But I live in a part of the country where I can (and do) access nothing but very, very fresh fruits, vegetables, high quality baked goods, cheeses, beers and wines, etc."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:21:50 UTC,393,"One major disagreement: There is a lot of really good cheese produced in this country. Especially Cheddar-style cheese from Vermont and Wisconsin. There is also some very good goat cheese. The rest of the cheese, you are right, it's mostly pretty terrible.  I think you had a very small sample size on your recent visit. For example, only the really cheap hotels use paper plates and plastic cutlery. If you chose to visit the cheapest hotels, that is biasing your sample.  The rest is just what you are habituated to. A typical American visiting Europe would think it's really bizarre to eat cold sliced meat at breakfast. We expect hot meats and freshly cooked eggs. When I visit Europe it's amazing to have 3 or 4 different types of fresh bread and 3-4 meats and cheeses, but it's not what we're used to."

Traffic lights are also like this in Ireland and the UK.  &gt; The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.  This is also fairly common in Ireland.

,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:29:51 UTC,80,"I went to LA recently and found the car centric culture suuuuper inconvenient for a tourist. Every time you want to see a thing, you need to research it beforehand and then drive there. Want to see another thing? More research, then drive. In just about any other city I've ever been I would just head to the city center and explore on foot and pop in to whatever place looked interesting.   Admittedly it was a short trip and maybe I did it wrong, but the closest thing to being able to just wander around was in downtown, and even there you occasionally have to walk over a nice 8 lane highway, which is a long way to walk (and be wary of certain neighborhoods and whatever).

There are definitely many commonalities but even as a born American, the diversity is still so amazing to me."
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 21:16:29 UTC,48,"Regarding free refills, the majority of restaurants in the US have carbonated drink dispensers, hooked up to boxes of soda syrup/juice in a back room. The syrup is mixed with water and CO2 as they dispense it. You’ll see they have “soda guns” at bars as well. This makes soda very inexpensive. Compared to many places in Europe where I notice only stocks soft drinks and juices in glass bottles and cans, so you order per item. Things I love about the Netherlands is how compact and well connected it is. In the USA I feel like we are forever just driving from parking lot to parking lot."
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 21:35:43 UTC,19,Oh yes the Netherlands is definitely compact and its much easier to get around. But I guess this is inevitable given the small size of the country. As is the opposite inevitable in such a large country as the US.
,comment,USA,,2023-05-15 00:41:01 UTC,14,I live in the US and totally agree with this assessment.   We love Europe. Things we don’t like so the hot and cold water comes out of different spouts in the sink and I am baffled about why. Kids hated them. Public transportation is amazing. Food is better. Easier to walk (also mostly cooler which makes that easier).   You’re so lucky to live in a cheese place 😍
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 23:08:00 UTC,26,"Great list, thanks for posting. As an American who has lived abroad, I agree on metric (much more logical, simple proportions, etc) but I will die on the Fahrenheit hill. It’s a scale aligned with how temperature is perceived by humans, and is much more intuitive. 0 is extremely cold, 100 is extremely hot.   The need to frequently use negatives,  and the requirement to use decimals to measure items that don’t necessarily require extreme precision (like an air conditioner thermostat) in Celsius is a little ridiculous."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 23:10:38 UTC,12,"If you look at it that way I will agree Fahrenheit does make sense. I was unaware of this perspective, thank you."
,comment,USA,Italy; New York; Vienna,2023-05-14 21:32:04 UTC,74,"As an American who lived in Europe for 6 years I enjoyed reading your list! It took me about a year of living abroad to understand the things I loved about my own country, including the vastness of nature, the general friendliness and openness, the ability to try lots of things out or shift careers, and the sense of humor (I found my Dutch friends to be most similar to me in openness and humor). I also understand that just because Americans are generally friendly on the surface it doesn’t mean we’re shallow or we make friends faster than Europeans — there’s just less daily friction in our interactions.   Ugh, the plastic! And tipping! Couldn’t agree more.   Food can be great here (even breakfast) but you have to know where to go and what to look for. Vermont, New York and Wisconsin make some stellar cheese, but again it takes some effort. As for food in general, it makes me cry that i can walk into a cafe in Vienna and eat a simple and beautiful 2 course meal for 10 Euros, and nothing like that exists here. My town has fantastic coffee shops but I’m not going to get a meal there. I’m still dreaming about the porchetta I had in Italy recently. It cracks me up to see so many American tourists asking about the best restaurants before going abroad. Just go into one — it will probably be better than most random food you find in the US."
,comment,USA,Asia; China; Japan,2023-05-14 22:36:14 UTC,20,"If you think plastic is bad in the US try Asia, like Japan or China. Insane amount of single use products."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 23:24:43 UTC,11,"I agree with everything except just walking into any restaurant because as a tourist in Europe, if you walk into a random restaurant, you're probably by something touristy and it's real hit or miss whether that is gonna be good/worth the price."
,comment,USA,New Orleans; Rome,2023-05-15 00:05:32 UTC,11,"Sure, I hear you. I use the same strategy I use if I’m in the middle of New Orleans or another US tourist destination: if they’re standing outside trying to get you in, and there’s a huge unchanging menu, I keep going. I just think people get hung up on finding the BEST something or other. Did I just have the best gelato in Rome? I don’t know. I went into a little place that looked good and I thoroughly enjoyed what I got."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:14:54 UTC,145,Wondering where you are going for breakfast that doesn't have fresh bread or meats as an option😂   100% agree re: tipping
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:20:05 UTC,123,"As an American, I’ve never been anywhere for breakfast with fresh breads other than biscuits. We also don’t eat cold cuts for breakfast almost unheard of. That’s what I’m guessing he’s referring to."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:43:57 UTC,107,"Yeah, it sounds like OP was trying to order the typical European breakfast in the US; i.e. bread, fruit, and cheese. They went wrong in not ordering breakfast burritos, scrambles, skillets, pancakes, waffles, french toast, benedicts, etc, etc, etc."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:36:09 UTC,36,There are lots of cafes and restaurants that serve breakfast and have fresh bread in most big cities. Typically not at a classic diner or chain restaurant but at nicer places.
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:27:32 UTC,21,"I think they are talking about hotel breakfasts. In Europe it's usually a bunch of breads, pastries, sliced meats, cheeses, and fruits. In the states it's eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles, pastries, and cereal."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:50:30 UTC,25,"Curious, have you been to Europe?  One of the things I like is breakfast.  Just a nice selection of breads, cheese, meet, etc.  We don't have the equivalent here in the US.  It's one of the things I like about Europe."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:44:42 UTC,39,"Ever been to the free breakfast at a 3-star chain hotel in the US?  Tends to be mostly sugary cereal, super processed preservative-filled breads and maybe some processed meats."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 23:18:56 UTC,11,"As a New Yorker, it's funny to see the vastness nature as the first one. Your post motivates me to go on domestic vacations instead of galavanting around Europe in the summers; I really haven't seen any of the US aside from the East Coast's major cities"
,comment,USA,Imperial; Netherlands,2023-05-14 20:52:19 UTC,32,"* Nature - natural resources have always been the big selling point. 
 * People are generally approachable and friendly - I think this changes depending on which area of the country you're in, but I also don't know anything about the Dutch in comparison.
   
 * Free refills - just 😂
   
 * Traffic lights across the street - weird to me that it would be any other way.
   
 * The doggy bag - I wouldn't have thought this was an issue anywhere. Is the resistance to taking home food a European thing or just in the Netherlands?
   
 * Tipping - Hard agree. I think most of us know this system isn't helpful and should be done away with.
   
 * The food, especially breakfast - there's a lot of variance, but we do overuse sugar (and salt) on top of having larger than needed portions.
   
 * Plastic - Again, hard agree. We need to do more to reduce our overuse on plastics, although we'll probably never be rid of them.
   
 * Imperial measurements - doesn't bother my day to day, but it would make more sense for there to be one international standard."

,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:16:32 UTC,40,I was born here and remember when I was young everyone was so terrified of the “metric system” that they literally ditched it cuz they felt we were all too dumb to teach it to. Now I know both as I am in the medical field and I can’t believe they didn’t just change it. 😂
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:17:10 UTC,20,"As an inpatient pharmacist, I get more annoyed by the day by the imperial system. Metric is so clean and makes so much sense, and I have to memorize the conversions to metric anyway 🙄"

,comment,USA,,2023-05-15 00:12:13 UTC,9,"&gt;In fact American cheese is awful  The joke is, we call it American cheese because only Americans will eat it. But real cheese exists as well, just not at fast food. We do not buy American cheese in our house."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-15 00:48:14 UTC,28,"I am American and I agree with everything you said except about the food. My breakfasts are usually either fried eggs or oatmeal with unsweetened fruit. Also, cheddar cheese isn’t bad. That’s like the most American of cheeses. When you are traveling in America look for breakfasts with fried eggs and toast. The variety of breads that you can get is actually impressive. My favorite is an egg with pumpernickel toast. If you are brave try an over easy egg on toast. Or, less brave try a soft oiled egg on toast. Very American, not too sugary."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:24:40 UTC,5,"Thank you for your thoughts. I'm an American who vacations in Europe every year (except covid) for a month or so, and I couldn't agree more with your comments -- on both sides. And it's nice to see it from your point of view.  Tipping in restaurants drives me nuts. It's a pet peeve of mine. Because of tipping, wait staff people get special wage and tax treatment. It's very complicated but they must think they come out ahead. I agree with you: just pay them a decent wage."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:33:51 UTC,19,"Love hearing your perspective! Pretty much agree with your dislikes, except a solid American breakfast made with quality ingredients and no sugar is easy to find and the best!"
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 21:24:49 UTC,19,"While I agree with your plastic comment, being an American who has lived in the Netherlands and travels there every year, the Netherlands doesn’t really have water refilling stations, anywhere. At least where I live, everyone carries a refillable bottle of water with them.   The other thing you forgot to mention on your list of reasons why America is better than the Netherlands is free bathrooms. The idea that you have to pay to pee in public is insane. Surely not everywhere charges in the Netherlands, but places that should be free - shopping malls, gas stations, public spaces, make you pay. That should be outlawed in my opinion."
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 21:29:36 UTC,8,"Oh yes you are absolutely right and I agree wholeheartedly. I have always found the lack of public bathrooms, let alone free ones, really annoying in the Netherlands.  Also I have enjoyed being able to get free water at the national parks that I visited here. But besides there and a few rest areas with water fountains, I haven't really seen water refill stations. But in the Netherlands our tap water is really good, so maybe that is the reason?"
,comment,USA,Netherlands,2023-05-14 23:00:49 UTC,7,"That’s why they should have refilling stations. The airport has one, but pretty much everywhere here has converted water fountains to combo water fountain and water refilling station. You can also get as much free tap water as you want from restaurants. Even at the saunas in the Netherlands (at least several of the ones I have been to) everyone is filling up their bottles in the toilet room, which is just gross.   America is the one place that doesn’t make you feel bad or try to capitalize on the human need to pee."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:16:02 UTC,4,"Yeah. Paying to use the restroom- particularly when you’re already paying to be at the location (museum, etc), I just don’t get it."
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:00:11 UTC,59,"Our food really isn't that bad, and much of it is quite good.  We also make excellent cheese. American cheese is underwhelming  but we have many others.  Cheddar is the best   Europe also has their share of boring cheese"

,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 22:03:00 UTC,11,Count me in another American who agrees with you on tipping.  It’s gotten worse since COVID.  I have to force myself to stop tipping especially when I’m ordering carryout and I’m coming to pick up the food myself.
,comment,USA,Most,2023-05-14 22:21:05 UTC,10,My biggest takeaway from visiting the US as an Australian was how friendly people are. Most aussies are know as being friendly but Americans top us on that front. In America be prepared to engage in chit chat nearly everywhere.   Also the food. There’s some amazing food in the states but it’s hard to find or very expensive.

,comment,USA,Most; Rome; Sheffield,2023-05-15 00:38:53 UTC,18,These comments are so funny. People do realise Europe isn’t one place?  Do you mean Sheffield or Rome?   The worst thing about American food is so many preservatives are used. Most of which are banned by the EU.
,comment,USA,,2023-05-14 21:45:58 UTC,11,"Im not sure processed meats count as ""Fresh meats"" for breakfast. lol  Theres also lots of good breakfast food in the US that isnt sugar. Gotta  have a good scramble or a hash or even just bacon and eggs and hashbrowns.   I mostly agree with you, but breakfast imo, is significantly better in NA than it is in europe. The vast majority of European breakfast i have had is processed meat, slices of cheese and bread. Which is more like lunch. The only advantage you have there is pastry IMO. And i have had bacon and sausages that are downright disgusting in Europe too and look like flappy grey meat. There really isnt anything better than freshly fried maple smoked bacon in the US.   But im sure alot of that comes down to taste."

,comment,USA,Chicago; Hungary; Italy; Miami; Seattle,2023-05-14 23:54:22 UTC,10,"Good analysis. But mate, if you’re not enjoying breakfast in the US, you’re definitely going wrong.   Breakfast is one of the things I missed most while living in Europe. Bacon, omelettes, lox, sausage, beef brisket and egg tacos, low key diners, high end brunch spots — the list is literally endless.   The variety of breakfast is one thing that the US absolutely shits on Europe. When I lived in Italy and Hungary, or traveling to most any of 27 countries — it was always a pastry, sliced meats, and espresso/cappuccino.   And good in general — at least in major markets — is phenomenal.   The US makes great cheese. It’s just the processed cheese is what you’ll find in most places. And even if you don’t like it can’t find the artisanal cheeses, you can still enjoy literally any type of imported cheese from Europe or the Middle East.   You need to do some more research on where you’re eating! If you’re in more remote areas and eating in small towns and stops outside of national parks, good luck. But if you’re not enjoying food in NYC, Miami, LA, SF, Chicago, Seattle, etc., then I don’t know what to say."
,comment,USA,Chicago; Of; Same,2023-05-14 21:32:43 UTC,13,"\-  Tipping isn't going anywhere.  A lot of service industry people like it because they make way more with the tipping than what the fixed wage would fall at.  Of course business owners like it because they can stiff people.  The problem I have with it, is its creeping into everything.  Like I'm not tipping my pharmacist unless they were giving me something on the side :)    \-  For breakfast, you need to hit the omelettes, sausage and bacon!    \- Plastic isn't going anywhere.  Same with free refills.  Every so often people try to outlaw free refills because of health conditions or whatever by taxing soda.  They tried this in Chicago and within minutes people were selling blackmarket soda without the tax.  Issue is restaurants selling togo stuff are expected to provide eating utensils, and a lot of places don't have the staff for people to wash.     \-  I'm employed in the sciences, imperial measurements are widely used in many applications.  Lots of pipe sizes for example fit in much better with english measurements."
