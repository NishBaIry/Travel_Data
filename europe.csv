Okay so my husband and I are starting to plan a European trip from end of Sept-mid October 2026. We are thinking of taking our kids (8 and nearly 10 at the time) we have had long chats with them explaining that it will be alot of walking (even more than we walked for the Taylor swift concert ü§£) and that they would have to be open to trying new foods and what not. They have been looking at photos of things to see in Europe and have started calling this trip their ‚Äúworld adventure‚Äù. I am agonizing over our itinerary and am hoping to get some advice!   Paris 6 nights. With day trips to Versailles and maybe Disneyland Paris for the kids?   Amsterdam 4 nights. This city is one of my must sees and the idea of sleeping on a boat really has the kids excited.    Barcelona 3 nights. The bright mosaic parts of this city really appeal to us and the kids love the pictures of this city the most.   Rome for 6 nights. I love Ancient Rome and all the history with it, and one of the kids is excited to be in the pasta motherland   London for 4/5 nights. Castles, yummy food ,and the guard with the fluffy black hats have the kids really excited.   Does this seem doable?? Or am I being unreasonable and insane with this plan ü§£. I‚Äôd like to see Florence and Venice as well but I don‚Äôt think that amount of travel is do-able? Or is it?! How many days do I realistically need at each stop to enjoy my time, not be rushing, and see everything? Could Florence be a day trip from Rome?! My concept of distance and time is not great and I often underestimate how much time I need in certain places."

I'd recommend using trains for traveling between Amsterdam, Paris and London if you havent thought about that already. Your kids will enjoy it a lot more than flying everywhere."

As for walking, you can add to the adventure for your kids by gamifying it a bit. All the cities on your list have been invaded by a street artist who installs mosaic art in the style of Space Invaders. There's an app where players get points for photos of the invaders. There's 162 in [London](https://www.space-invaders.com/world/london/), 75 in [Rome](https://www.space-invaders.com/world/rome/), 26 in [Amsterdam](https://www.space-invaders.com/world/amsterdam/), 17 in [Barcelona](https://www.space-invaders.com/world/barcelone/), and  a whopping 1,549 in [Paris](https://www.space-invaders.com/world/paris/).

A night train, or any train for that matter, is a true lifesaver when it comes to traveling with kids. It's much less hassle than air travel and it's so nice to have a cabin where everyone can stretch their legs a bit more!"

Couple suggestions on route to save you a bit of headache. Would fly into London from the US (short-ish flight + the 9am-9pm flight is amazing for jet lag). I like to book a hotel around Heathrow and just go straight to sleep after the ~9pm arrival.   Highly recommend taking Eurostar from London-Paris-Amsterdam (kiddos will love the fast trains), and it‚Äôs MUCH easier than dealing with airports in London/Paris.   Fly from Amsterdam to Barcelona - you will already be in the Schengen area so no border security there. Then I would fly Barcelona to Rome and back to the US from Italy. Reason being, Barcelona border control can be a mess (2h waits are not unheard of) + is not something you‚Äôll wanna deal with after such a long trip. Italy lets US citizens use their E-Gates so you will breeze through passport control (also Rome is beautiful in October).   For the best prices, look into a multi-city ticket (google flights has this option). I would try to book USA-London and Italy-USA on the same PNR, which will likely give you a pretty decent discount over one-way flights). Intra-Europe flights are usually pretty cheap with budget carriers as well. Safe travels and have fun!"
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 12:35:44 UTC,13,Plus flying into London from the us is always the cheapest option
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 15:45:11 UTC,1,"Costs have many factors at play, but flights to London have a ton of taxes. It‚Äôs certainly not the cheapest to fly to out of all of Europe, even though it‚Äôs a shorter flight. On this persons list, London may actually be the most expensive. I have no idea they‚Äôre originating airport though."
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 13:40:17 UTC,3,On that note - London departure taxes are ruinous - starting in London will be both cheaper and easier on your kids for cultural adjustment.  Our first London trip we did the civilized 9am daytime departure and it was definitely the way to go.  Land at 9p local and you can hop the Paddington Express out of Heathrow and be near a number of hotels in town in 30 minutes.  The Hilton Metropole works well.

All big cities start to look alike after a while, especially for kids. Add a few days in the Alps, for example, with a scenic train ride and simple hikes with geocaching."
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 07:04:33 UTC,16,Agree to this.   I would recommend to swap out one of those cities for a few days at a farm/estate with pool and a lot of land (for the kids to run in) in Tuscany. A few days of peace and quiet with absolutely stunning hilly views. A place to recharge your batteries.
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 07:23:16 UTC,6,That sounds fabulous too. We rented a villa in Tuscany once with a pool. It was cheaper than a hotel in any of these touristy cities and a magical experience.

,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 12:09:32 UTC,2,Not the Alps at that time of the year though maybe? The weather can be bad.
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 13:11:32 UTC,2,Not necessarily. You can get some good hiking in at lower altitude and many trails are still accessible even when it starts to snow. End of September can still be pretty mild with 10-20 degrees during the day. Last year in the German alps it was still around 25 in the afternoon on some days in late September.
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 17:58:31 UTC,1,Venice!
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-27 03:20:03 UTC,1,"Agreed.  My kids get bored of museums and cathedrals snd cities.  The hiking and playgrounds in the Austrian ski resorts are spectacular.  My kids could spend days on the playgrounds/ trails at Schlick/ Mieders, Serfaus, Fiss, Seefeld.  Crowds are minimal in Sept and weather is still nice, usually.  Also, the Almabtrieb festivals are great (they bring the cows down to the valley and decorate them with flowers‚Äîthe best milk producers get the most flowers).  Haven‚Äôt been to the French Alps in summer‚Äîit may be similar and closer to the rest of your itinerary.  Or a farm stay."
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-27 07:19:49 UTC,1,"Absolutely agree. Six days in Paris is three days too many in this itinerary, imo. Make room for some time in the mountains/at the beach/a random rural area. They all hold something interesting (esp. compared to the US flyover states, perhaps, even though I really find this term horrible as they also have their merits, I suppose)"
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 06:20:53 UTC,58,"Brilliant. You‚Äôre doing many things right - the total time of the trip and longer stays in cities. If anything, I‚Äôd cut it down to three cities and spend more time in each. I‚Äôd also consider swapping out some time in Normandy (Caen?) for one of the bigger cities to get a bit more variety."

You‚Äôll need that day to recharge. It might be possible to take a train for some legs of the journey, which would be well worth it."

Can just relax on a train and also it will drop you off pretty much smack bang in the middle of the city. Airports can be a drag mentally and when you do finally get to your destination, you then need a taxi or a bus to get into the city."
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 13:04:34 UTC,3,"Agreed.   Took a trip to UK last month and used intracity trains.  More relaxing because you can get up &amp; move around more, look at scenery,  etc"

You get to see the country more from a train than a plane and you arrive at the city center. I might be biased as a train nerd, but when we traveled by train in Europe when I was very young the train rides were one of the highlights of the trip."

Train to Barcelona though won't work, which is one reason I'd axe that for Venice or Geneva or someplace vaguely between Rome and Paris."

Don't go to Lux or Strasbourg with such limited time. Do the Eiffel tower, the Colosseum and the Sagrada Familia. It will be memorable. Also, Barcelona and surroundings have a nice beach so you could always have a lazy beach day in between.   Nice plan, OP, it will be exhausting but beautiful. I am fond of all those places (even living in one of them)"
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 10:58:52 UTC,3,I did Paris to Barcelona on the train a few years ago and it was perfect. 6 hours but we left early in the morning and arrived in Barcelona pretty much on time for the hotel check in.  Doing the equivalent flight accounting for transport to and from the airport plus having to be at the airport about 1-2 hours before would probably take roughly the same amount of time (but be far more draining mentally).

My only thought is that the Barcelona and Rome parts put you in two very different spots.  You could consider choosing one or the other and adding destinations in the respective country.  For example on Italy you could add Florence and Siena, or further south toward Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast.  In Spain some similar jaunts.  That would reduce the travel time.  But what you have said here seems eminently doable in any case.  Enjoy your trip."

London-Paris-Amsterdam is doable but both Rome and Barcelona not really. You‚Äôre gonna be wasting a lot of time getting from one place to another. I‚Äôm thinking flying into London would make the most sense and then making your way by Eurostar to Amsterdam, another Eurostar/Thalys to Paris, then down to Lyon for a few days, and lastly EITHER Barcelona or Rome."

Paris to Rome is longer, but two days in Milan breaks it up nicely (and you can do two fewer days in Amsterdam unless the kids are really into red light districts and cannabis cafes).  The train ride through Switzerland into Milan has beautiful views, probably one of the nicest train rides in the world."

Then almost 5 on a 4-week holiday in NZ. So they are not too young. You and they will have a great holiday. The only thing is that they may get bitten by the travelling bug as my son was!  Some of the tricks that we did was teaching him ""democracy"". Each day, I had picked 3 things that we all would be interested in, but we would only have time for one or two. So, at breakfast, we decided where to go, and his voice counted as much as ours, if not more. Some days, it was pure dictatorship, we adult wanted to see something, but then we made up for it by going to a playground. This became the norm for the rest of our trips. Now, my son has his own family, and I'm a widow solotravelling, I still find more things to do than I have time for each day, prioritising them depending on mood and weather ...  Another thing is that we made treasure hunt with tiny bags of candy, or who finds most blue signs, if we had to walk a lot or if we wanted to see a forrest. We still talk of son's ""marathon"" in NZ where we did a 10 km day hike (5 yo) by building cairns along the way ...   I love to tell stories, so I have found interesting houses and told stories about people living there, sometimes true, sometimes pure fantasy with knights and monsters. At a museum, don't look at the great view of Mona Lisa, e.g., but turn around 180¬∞ and tell stories about what Mona Lisa has seen over the years. Or tell about the baker in the corner of a 3x5 m painting of a coronation.  I think your plans sounds really good. I hope you'll have a fantastic holiday, may the sun shine but not too hot"

So maybe just do 3 nights a small City in Italy + go by train to Rome and do 3 nights Rome....   / I personally would even do 4 nights peschiera del garda (to be one time not in a big city + gardaland is next door + verona is my favourite city in Italy) and 2/3 nights rome....

My tips:  - consider adding a ‚ÄúKid‚Äôs Choice‚Äù day in each location. My kids are more amenable to museums and cultural attractions if they know they get a day of mini golf or laser tag or video arcade or whatever. - Agree that doing London - Amsterdam-Paris via train is eminently doable and will be a lot more relaxing &amp; fun than the plane. The seats are more spacious, often there‚Äôs WiFi etc. A day with a 3-4 hour train ride is part mini-adventure, part chill day. You won‚Äôt regret it.  - agree with picking Spain OR Italy and flying there from Amsterdam or Paris depending on order. You could fly to Rome and go to Siena or Florence or the Amalfi Coast (stay in Atrani!), or you could fly to Barcelona and add on the Costa Brava or Sevilla (Barcelona - Seville is a long train ride, you might want to fly). Of those itineraries I would pick Rome + Siena because I LOVE Italy but YMMV. - in Rome we did the COOLEST coliseum tour where we did a virtual reality tour of the coliseum with VR headsets before heading into the coliseum itself. The graphics were not the most sophisticated, but it was mind blowing to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the rendering of the giant shade structure (with shades that rolled open and shut over the entire arena), then pull off your headset and see the stone where the ropes were tethered like ten feet away. Similarly, you see a rendering of a gladiator washing the blood off himself in the Victor‚Äôs Fountain‚Äî the fountain today is nothing much to look at but once you‚Äôve seen the rendering it‚Äôs so much easier to picture. Highly recommended."

Or if time is limited a kids pick in the day. My daughter and I did that in Prague last year - she picked the City of Prague Museum (overpriced for what it was but oh well) and I picked the Museum of Communism. She didn‚Äôt exactly love my choice but she did engage and we had a really good day.

We ended up training 1000 miles and then just settling in one place when we got there, and then just exploring that area intensely.  We probably could have gotten away with exploring a bit further afield for a few more days than we did but honestly, the kids got to a point quick where they didn‚Äôt want to pack and shift anymore - they could see something that they wanted to do and I could tell them confidently that we could check it out later that week/next week, etc.  Less of a rushed experience.  But - you know your kids, and they‚Äôre all different!  This sounds like a fun trip as an adult, and I‚Äôm sure there are kids out there who would do great with this."

Kids will always eat pizza and gelato!  The one thing I am not sure about is the overall length of the trip.  We've found even with older kids that the eyes tend to glaze over by about day 21.  A few thoughts:  Disneyland for the kids makes sense.  I am now acquainted with Rome's zoo (meh) because my kids needed a day for stuff they liked.  Recognize you may have to do one of those once in a while.  Frank bribery works.  We were clear that we were going to spend half a day in the Vatican / Sistine Chapel, not a big kid priority but obviously one for the parents.  We promised aforementioned gelato for lunch.  You get to do stuff like that once in a while.  Stuff where kids can run around is helpful.  I recommend Ostia Antica outside of Rome.  Trafalgar Square in London.  The London Eye is great fun at that age.   Look into medieval dinners.  Covent Garden can be a crowd-pleaser.  I'm not 100% sold on Barcelona at that age, particularly for only three days.  Swap for Venice?  Very kid-friendly city.  About 4 hour train ride from Rome IIRC and then you can go through the Alps to Paris.  Florence definitely not, need older kids for that, it's a lot of museum time.  But 100% go.  Our kids are now world travelers because they started at this age and caught the bug."

You are very city heavy and after a while the nuance between, say Paris and Rome, won't mean much to the kids.  Consider swapping out a city for a country side abd/or coast.

In the cities your hotels might be limited, make sure to book early and look for family suites or you might need to book two separate rooms in some places if the family suites are taken. It‚Äôs easy to find a room for 1-3 people, 4 limits you. I travel a lot, the EU is the most strict I‚Äôve found at the number of people in the rooms.   I‚Äôd plan a few relax days. My kids are younger but they LOVED Tuscany and just playing by a pool eating their weight in gelato.   I personally liked Copenhagen more than Amsterdam and so did my kids, but you put it as a must see.   It‚Äôs doable but I find transitioning between places so much with kids we do more in leas stops. You can be in cities for years and not see everything. Make a list of what you want to do the most. Maybe have each person have a top thing they want in each location. If you love history in Rome book a private tour of the Vatican, you get in before they open to the general public and it‚Äôs basically empty! Such perfect pictures and you have someone pointing everything out and answering questions.   You have to consider packing and repacking for this with kids. You‚Äôll need everything from summer to fall clothing. I try to stick to one climate to limit what we need to bring from a packing standpoint, especially with multiple travel days, kids and souvenirs. You might be less annoyed with this than I am, but carrying suitcases in European cities with cobblestone and up and down stairs‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt my favorite. Just keep that in mind if you‚Äôre heavy packers. My kids aren‚Äôt great at carrying suitcases up and down train stairs and platforms. This factors into an itinerary for me but I recognize not everyone else is fazed by packing up every few days with kids and lugging suitcases."

,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-27 07:39:42 UTC,2,"Paris is definitely the hub in all this: there are direct trains from Paris to Barcelona (7h), London (2h) and Amsterdam (3.5h). Rome requires a change in Turin (yes there are direct trains from Paris to Turin!) and is closer to ten hours. Apart from Rome, the journey times by train are about the same/quicker than the total time you'll spend doing ""city centre &gt; airport &gt; security &gt; flight &gt; city centre"". There is 'airport-style' security for the train to London but you're still travelling from the centre of Paris. The other destinations will check your ticket but that's about it. All of these journeys will provide great views of varied countryside, and the train to Turin goes right through the Alps, by October you might see a bit of snow on the peaks.  Disneyland may be a waste of your time/money if you've already been to other Disneylands (disclaimer, I've only been to the Paris one) - I assume they're all very similar.  Paris has lots of other child-friendly options that aren't Disneyland, though if a theme park is what you want then Parc Ast√©rix is also near Paris (there are shuttle buses) and is more 'French'; It's themed around a the famous French children's comic series Asterix, but remains a proper theme park with rides for all ages.  Another option instead of Disney is La Cit√© des Sciences ( [https://www.cite-sciences.fr/en/home](https://www.cite-sciences.fr/en/home) ) in the 19e, a science museum with lots of stuff for children.  Oh and for London, apart from the Tower, you'll need to leave London to see castles. If you want a military style castle (knights etc) then Dover Castle (an incredible range of history: some parts built by the Romans, still in use in WW2) is very good and within range of London for a day. Warwick Castle (a filming location for Harry Potter) is amazing too but is perhaps a bit too far for a day? If you want stately homes (ie British equivalent of French ch√¢teaux) then there are a few palaces within London, but if not Blenheim Palace (Churchill's birthplace) is a good option, perhaps as part of a trip to see Oxford, or of course there's Highclere where they filmed Downton."

Definitely look into going between some of the places by train if you can - it's a more exciting journey and gives the kids a better sense of where places are in relation to one another.  My kids are nearly grown up now but I loved travelling with them when they were small.  We planned a lot of park stops and cafe stops into our trips.  If the kids are not that used to walking and public transport it might help to build up their stamina with a few local trips before you go on your big trip if possible.

I did do a similar Europe trip their age with my family and loved it. Itinerary wise I would second what others are saying and explore smaller cities in either Spain or Italy to break up all the big cities and see what Europe really has to offer. If you‚Äôre in Rome then heading south to the Amalfi coast and Sorrento, for instance. The area is beautiful and personally changed my life. (I also personally hate Paris and wouldn‚Äôt do 6 nights but that‚Äôs just preference)."
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 08:29:17 UTC,1,"It seems like a very challenging journey to me. Children may get tired or bored after 7/10 days.   Furthermore, the climate is different between Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) and Northern Europe (London, Amsterdam). In September/October there can be temperature differences of up to 10¬∞C/15¬∞C. In Rome you could find 30¬∞C in September while in London in October you could find 15¬∞C in October. This forces you to bring suitable clothes so your luggage will not be light and moving will be more complicated.   It might make more sense to take two trips of 15 days each: one to the north, the other to the south.   Staying on your travel plan I can give you some information.   From Rome you can go to Venice by train in about four hours without changing. I recommend it because children really like Venice: there are no cars and everything travels on water, even ambulances or firefighters! Instead skip Florence, but don't avoid Venice.   Florence is an hour and a half by train from Rome, so, yes, it can be a day trip.    Visits that children may enjoy:  - in Venice visit the Murano glass workshops - in Florence climb the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore and/or Giotto's bell tower  - in Rome go up to the terrace of the dome of St. Peter's - in Rome go to the point where Bernini's colonnade can be seen completely lined up - in Rome go up to the circular transept of St. Peter's and speak against the wall to be heard on the opposite side.   In Italy emergency public medical assistance is almost free even for foreigners but it is a good idea to inform yourself and get travel insurance anyway.   Let me know if I was helpful to you."

We were worried they were too young but it was one of the best things we ever did.  We flew into Paris and out of Rome with about 4 nights each but the highlight was 7 nights at an agritourismo winery/olive grove by San Donato in Tuscany.  We had a pool there and did day trips with a car all around Tuscany including a day trip to Florence. We could walk into the small town for ice cream and dinners, cook our own meals, and had access to hiking trails.  That gave us a ton of flexibility with the kids to relax or go on mini adventures and there was still enough small scale culture and history to keep things interesting with the day trips.    For us the two big cities at each end of the trip were enough large scale experiences.  They were worth doing but more stressful so the long break in the middle really worked well.   Also our youngest was a pretty picky eater but nearly every restaurant was willing to make butter noodles or something simple like a cheese sandwich that was not on the menu.  Oh and the Italians love kids so having them with us led to chances to talk to the locals.   Btw in Paris the highlight was a city bike tour which sounded scary but felt safe and we saw a ton of stuff. We used the Fat Tire tour but there are others."

Things to remember, rest days and play time!  If I think I can see all the sites and do what I want in a city in 3 days, I add a day because my kiddo needs more down time than I do and he needs time at a local playground to not have to be doing new things and just move his body. Don't be surprised if both your kids, but especially the 8 year old, suddenly need an afternoon nap again.   I recommend for city days (excluding Disneyland Paris) to try to do 1 activity per section of the day- eg 1 morning activity, break for lunch and not lunch on the run, but a bit of a rest, 1 afternoon activity, then break for afternoon snack and, as your kids are older, maybe an evening activity, then dinner. It's a slightly slower way to travel, you sometimes have to cancel things or move things around. Every other day or so should have at least half the day as a rest day/play it by ear day to see how your kids are doning and give them time to chill or play.   Day trips can be great, Florence from Rome is possible, but I wouldn't book things like that until you see how your kids are doing, fortunately, you're traveling in the shoulder season in all these locations, so you can book things once you reach each city and see how the trip is going. Especially at the end of the trip, everyone will be tired and you may just need to cut some things out.   Have fun!"

First you are spending an entire month in big gritty cities with few day trips. The day trips are the highlight in my opinion. Second there is too much travel (six days of flying or trains) for children. You only have two days in Barcelona for example. Why bother?

This is especially the case for Amsterdam and London, but due to the rising water temperature of the Mediterranian Sea, weather in Barcelona and Rome may also be less predictable.  My main advice would be to invest in some good, lightweight soft shell or hard shell rain- and windproof jackets (Patagonia, Haglofs, Bergans, Rab or the like). Especially if you'd want to include (mountain) hiking in your trip, these will come in very handy. Sure beats ponchos or umbrellas.  If you follow the advice to take the train through Europe, buy tickets way in advance to get the best deals and to be able to sit together. For trains, I'd look into an itinerary that splits Paris in two visits: Amsterdam‚ÄîParis‚ÄîLondon‚ÄîParis‚ÄîBarcelona is very doable with Europe's high speed train network. Barcelona to Rome would be easiest by plane.  Happy planning, and enjoy your holiday next year!"

Fly in to London.  Eurostar to Paris.  Train to Amsterdam.  Fly to Barcelona.  Fly to Rome.  Fly out from Rome.  Consider every flight a lost day with a bonus evening.  Domestic flights are time sinks in Europe, plus you'll be travelling with luggage on non-Schengen passports.   Amsterdam and Barcelona need the least time, out of your list.  A couple of days in Barcelona and you'll have seen the key sites and eaten some great tapas."

I would personally drop Barcelona. Travelling to Spain for 3 days and 2 days travel to me doesn't seem worth it. They are also very bitter about tourism right now. Come back and do Spain at some point. It's vast and has amazing villages and cities worth visiting beyond Barcelona.  This will buy you 5 days to get out the cities more either on day trips or maybe a relaxing stay in the countryside in the UK or a drive through Wales or the Cornwall etc. I think you need some time to relax and get some fresh air. Urban exploration and working out new cities every 4 or 5 days  is tiring. The kids could do with a break and actually get some perspective of where they are.   It seems a shame to come to Europe for that long snd not see the sea, the mountains or the countryside almost at all.   I would also change the order.   Fly into London. Eurostar to Paris or go up the  Northumberland coast maybe via York and then get the ferry from Newcastle to Amsterdam. Then Paris and fly to Italy before returning or if you have the time you could consider a night train Thello to Rome.   This also means easing into the trip in an English speaking country.   You may want to check if flying back via London works out cheaper, so getting a connection from Italy via Heathrow."

I went as a kid and a day was way to rushed so then it begs the question, do you want to come all the way to Europe to then multiple days doing something American which you can just do at home. I would much rather use the aforementioned saved time and your Disney land days to for example train to Switzerland and hire a car for 3 or 4 days and explore the mountains before forwarding to Italy. I promise you, your kids need some variety and some rest. Like 3 or 4 days on 2 days off.    Example london 5 days including arrival day  Travel day UK countryside 3 days , chill and explore  Travel day Amsterdam 4 days plus day trip to delft or somewhere like Haarlem Travel day Paris 4 days plus day trip to versailles   Travel day Swiss mountains or Italian countryside maybe  , recover 3 days Travel day  Rome 4 days   Leave   This is 29 days ish which leaves you a few days if more Travel time needed or downtime. Of course logistically adding in places that aren't just big cities and easy connections takes more planning and kids in tow can be tricky."
,comment,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,Amsterdam; Barcelona; Florence; London; Paris; Rome; Taylor; Venice; Versailles,2025-07-26 13:18:24 UTC,1,"I live in London, travel a lot and have 2 now grown kids who we have visited those cities with them except for Rome, Barcelona, Florence and Venice, which we visited without them.  All of these cities have excellent, affordable public transport systems.  This is specific advice for going with kids your age.  Arrive in London by air (I am assuming you are coming from the States) and spend at least 6 nights there.  It's core tourist centre is physically larger than all the other cities and there will be no language barrier for their first European destination. London does not have castles, unless you count Windsor castle, which is London adjacent.  Then take the Eurostar to Amsterdam. You could get away with 3 nights as the centre is very compact. If you are going to stay on a boat be aware it will be tiny compared to a hotel room and you will be paying more for the novelty value.  Paris by train should be next on your list and I would do 2 days in Disneyland with them. Trying to fit it all into one day is only going to end with overtired kids and frustration. Make sure to avoid the UK school holidays which are around the last week of October.  This is where you need to open your wallet and try to stay on site for one night with their 1 night 2 day pass option. This gives you early access to the park for 2 days.  On the day you arrive show up a little bit before the park opens, leave your luggage with them and head off to the park.  They will text you when your room is ready, so you can go back for naps or just to chill out a bit and then back to the park as many times as you like. That means you can stay up for the fireworks without fear of meltdowns!   You are all set for early access the following morning.  Pack all your stuff and you have the choice of going back to your room for a break before check out and then leaving your luggage at the hotel until you leave the park or just checking out and leaving your luggage at the hotel first thing.  Onto Rome.  Don't miss it ! We held off for years and went without the kids.  We loved it and at the age yours are at now they would have too.  That should be more than enough packing, unpacking and travelling for just under a month with kids.  Barcelona, lovely, but don't go just for the bright mosaic parts of the city, I assume you are referring to Gaudi's work.  They are few and far between in comparison to the rest of the city and it will be a schlep to get there and on to anywhere else on your plan.  Venice, again too much travel time and not enough time to give it justice.  The kids are likely to love it more when they are older.  Florence in a day is hard on the feet, very crowded and less obviously kid friendly, technically doable from Rome, but exhausting and more of a tickbox experience even without kids.

Also you have a long stay in Rome. If you‚Äôre looking for down time/beach day for the kids check out Sperlonga or Terracina - both about 1/1.5 hours away.

Kids will not like walking everyday for hours. Check with the hotel concierge about a nanny. Maybe for a date night or day without kids.

Instead we rent a car and drove to the Loire valley. They are full of beautiful castles and very different from one another. Our kids loved sleeping in one, running around those beautiful gardens  &amp;  eating in a cave. I actually prefer these over Versailles. We drove to a place called Puy du Fou where they have a Medieval theme park where they have actors dress up as knights and joust. We then flew to Stockholm. They enjoyed the old town, beautiful harbors and boat trips in the Archipelago &amp; the Skansen outdoors museum. We took a boat trip to visit Drottnighholm, the Swedish royal residence. We also drove a couple hours north to visit Astrid Lindgren‚Äôs world (Pippy Longstocking). They didn‚Äôt complain once on the trip. Since then, we have done multiple trips abroad with them.

Rude, underpaid and exhausted staff is the norm. They will not care even if you complain.

In Barcelona I‚Äôve stayed with this company and they have a number of great apartments;  https://www.ainb.net/en/home/  I‚Äôd recommend the gothic quarter because it‚Äôs a great neighbourhood with lots of small atmospheric alleyways. You‚Äôll love it.  Nearby is this art gallery which the kids should like;  https://www.mocomuseum.com/barcelona/  There‚Äôs one in Amsterdam and London too‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ if that creates a nice thread to follow during your holiday?  Las Ramblas is nice enough during the day and you should go to La Boqueria market to eat, but at night it‚Äôs really quite seedy so not particularly recommended to stay too close with children."

Sure renting that stuff &amp; 4 chairs &amp; umbrellas is pricey but could be their favorite day.    - start the planning with *their* existing interests as goals. Our boy loved trains so we went on steam excursions, and came to love trains ourselves. Do they play soccer? While First Division matches are a spectacle, second or even third division, especially in a smaller town, are totally fun &amp; totally ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù.  In Barcelona, tour Camp Nou.    - Just because something is on the TripAdvisor Top 10 things to do doesn‚Äôt mean it is right for your specific family. There‚Äôs so much to see and do in Europe just accept you‚Äôre going to miss a lot. Don‚Äôt torture them with yet another church (doesn‚Äôt matter how grand, to the 10 year old mind anything past the first one is BO-RING!!) or museum.    - Skip Disneyland. See it on a different trip to Orlando or LA. Time in Europe better spent on European things. That said, a local amusement park? By all means, go!  Have a great trip!"

Couldn‚Äôt agree more.  Great recs.  In Germany and Austria (and I imagine France /  Italy) there are Kletterwalds (climbing forests)‚Äîa safe ropes course in a forest. With multiple levels of difficulty.  For 20‚Ç¨ (similar ones in Colorado are $79 and not nearly as cool).    The regular park playgrounds in Germany and Austria are also amazing (I imagine France/Ned too). My kids love those.    Also agree with seeing a lower league soccer match.  Those a great and inexpensive.

What do you want to see in Amsterdam? I live there, so maybe I can help you out with planning. Overall, I think that overdoing it will wear them out. I Assume that you are American, so things will be different here.  Kids idea:   \- Nemo (Museum)   \- Scheepsvaart museum (They have a real size sail ship, like the one Columbus went on)   \- Eating patat: French fries Dutch style (Bigger and double fried)   \- Go to Haarlem, it is like Amsterdam but quieter and smaller (Netherlands best shopping city).   \- Take the Train to Haarlem (if they never been on a train)   \- Go to the Beach at Zandvoort (if they never been there, I don't know where you live but I heard that that is a thing)   \- Skip Volendam, go to Zaanse Schans instead. Zaanse Schans has Windwills and the kids can run around.   \- Naturalis: Natural Historic Museum in Leiden. Leiden is an old city, just like Haarlem. Go by train.   \- Instead of walking in Amsterdam, take trams or buses.. They will bring you almost everywhere and they may find it cool.   \- Rondvaartboot tour: a boat tour through the canals.   \- Muiderslot at Muiden, Medieval Castle and a cute town or Kasteel de Haar, bigger castle near Vleuten   I wouldn't go six days to Paris, but that depends on your bucket list.. When they've been to Disneyland an option maybe to go one extra day to Amsterdam and go to the Efteling. Also easy to do by Train from Amsterdam.  Did I already mention our Public Transport? :D 85% of the Dutch live 300 yards from a Public Transport stop, so it is pretty dense and brings you everywhere."

You will see a ton of big tourist boats, where you get a canned loudspeaker tour. My suggestion is checking out Those Dam Boat Guys. Their boats only fit ten or so, your captain is right there sitting next to you telling you about the city, you can chat with him. You can bring your own snacks &amp; drinks. If it is chilly, they offer blankets and hot water bottles. It's a little more expensive than the big cruise boats but so worth it, it is like sailing with friends."

These are all highly walkable cities with loads of kid-friendly eating, and by late September the weather should be pretty perfect in all those places.  You might consider 4 nights in Barcelona and just 5 nights in Rome. Don't get me wrong, I love Rome, but Barcelona has nearby beaches that are great (I recommend ones out of the city, e.g., Platja de Ocata is an easy 25 minutes by train and the train literally stops at the beach), and maybe you can take one of the days trips up to Costa Brava."

My brother would also get really hungry, and then get picky, so we did best when traveling with snacks  We did two weeks per city, which was a little too long, but three days is a little short - generally the travel days make everyone worn out, and you won‚Äôt want to do much else after.   We stayed on a boat in Amsterdam, and, if you have ever gotten motion sickness, ask your doctor for scopalomine patches.

Those are amazing ages for travel and I like your itinerary. My best suggestions: 1) Fly into one city and out of another so no backtracking. 2) Take (high speed when possible) trains between locations. Way easier logistically and most interesting. (Train stations are central, and you can be at the train station maybe 20 or 30 minutes before departure instead of two hours at an out of town airport.) (Looking at your cities, I‚Äôd work my way by train London to Barcelona, then fly or take a ferry to Rome, then fly home from Rome.) 3) Many days we planned for a morning activity, mid day down time/nap (during peak tourist hours), then an afternoon/evening activity. Eg morning market, then late afternoon evening cool church/museum. 4) Some of the playgrounds in London are incredible. Make them destinations by themselves. 5) Pack very light, stay somewhere with laundry every second destination. 6) Use the Mooveit app and public transit. The buses in Rome and London are awesome and cheap and that really cut down our walking.  Have fun!"

I think 27-28 days is 100% fine but too much air travel or long train travel IMO. Pick the region or country you like the best and get to know it. Spend enough time in each spot to really feel immersed in the culture. Travel days with young kids isn‚Äôt that much fun.   I‚Äôm currently on a 35 day trip with a 9/10/13 year old 75% of time in Italy by train and car- rest in France.  It‚Äôs not without issue but mostly great.

Not insane. Your starting itinerary is fine, the main thing to remember is that when changing cities it's going to eat half to most of a day. Whenever possible, I aim for 3-7 nights in a given place. 2. It's a lot of city. You may want to mix in some country and driving time (renting a car is a good and flexible and easy option) to allow quieter and more naturey experiences.  3. Involving your kids is smart and good. But, remember that they're still kids so things like pool/beach, ice cream, shopping/chillin, along with small doses of history and art is a good way to go. For example, in Paris, my kids loved a few hours in the Louvre and dorsay and rodin, but not all the same day, and they unexpectedly loved Giverny, but we also built in a bunch of carousels, ice cream, and cafe stops to sit and enjoy a drink and sketch the scenes. 4. Definitely recommend an open jaw flight itinerary, so that you're backtracking as little as possible. E.g., into London, out of Rome. 5. Everyone gets a ""must"" - something the rest of the group has to do for that one person (ideally, multiple people want to do it). If everyone gets a ""must"" and a ""want"" then the kids will also learn the give and take of planning a trip, getting through something that you don't love because someone else does and they'll do the same for you, etc.  6. Meals - very country dependent, but typically in Western Europe you won't want to be dining out for multiple meals per day, if not for expense then for time reasons. Utilize nearby grocery stores for breakfast or lunch or possibly dinner at your lodging, depending on your schedule and timing needs. 7. Lodging - City and country dependent, but with a family it's often better to look at airbnbs or apartments rather than hotels, which tend to be small and have very limited bed/sleeping arrangements for families. ETA: 8. It's great that they are getting ideas based on photos of monuments or sites, but in my experience going to those famous sites just to see them is not very satisfying for kids. If there's some way that they can interact with it (eg climb the Eiffel tower or Arc de Triomphe, or stroll park guell, or cycle the Dutch canals), then it tends to be great."

There are so many lakes, rivers, forests, mountains, beaches... and then with kids,. You can do a museum or a cathedral every now and then, but every single day? You are also mentioning 'see everything'. I think it's better if you don't try to see everything. If you see everything, you get all the touristic highlights that are crowded and carved into a tourist experience but you won't even see the cities as they really are, plus there 's always more.

There's a lot to see and the kids will probably need some time to let it all percolate in their minds. I would plan on having rest days which can coincide with when the weather isn't great. Be flexible and be mindful of their ability to schlep around and absorb new information and experiences.  I've been looking into houseboats in Amsterdam as a place to,stay. I love it there and plan to spend a month or two at a time going forward. I was just there last June. The central area is very busy with tourists. However, even with the overwhelming amount of fellow tourists, it's still a great place to be. You can also do easy day trips to Haarlem and even stay there as it's less busy, less expensive, and more family friendly. Haarlem is only a 15-20 minute train ride from Amsterdam Centraal and they also have canals and houseboats. Hanging out in the AmsterdamHaarlem area could easily absorb 15 fantastic and relaxing travel days. Get the Museumkaart for unlimited museum visits and there are many kid friendly ones. If the your children enjoy traveling this time they'll be happy and eager to return and see other countries on later trips. The Netherlands is a great country to start with."

I‚Äôm also planning a 30 day trip with my family next year to Europe. Have you been to Paris? That seems like a long time there. I‚Äôd say 3-4 days max in Paris. Also do you research on Rome. It‚Äôs perhaps the most congested and touristy loud city on your itinerary. Not trying to be negative sorry if it sounds that way. Do you have any thoughts about leaving the big cities for more provincial areas that are scenic for a break from the city?   We are doing Northern Europe and Paris next June. We plan on working remotely from a home-base on the german/french border and taking the bullet train to various locals for long weekends. Ultimately our family opted for a smallish walkable town with bullet train access and a euro rail pass. We will fly into Paris and take the train to our home base. Then visit various places before taking the train to Paris and then London (via air or train not sure) on our way home. Staying in London/whitehall for a couple days before flying home from Heathrow.   Hope your family enjoys their time!

The train station in Florence is really near the main attractions of the city. I promise you will not regret it. Venezia is a bit of a stretch from Roma. Maybe 4 days in Amsterdam is too much, imho,  you could travel from Paris to Brugge or Antwerpen, a couple of days there and a couple to Amsterdam. All those cities are really enjoyable by kids, been there while my daughter was 10, there a fable magic vibe all around"

I have never been to Europe and would love help deciding where to go. Originally my plan was to travel to Amsterdam in late April - mid May to enjoy the tulip fields and Kings day, then fly to Crete for a week to explore historical places and soak on the beaches. I would love to still do both of these things but I realize we can now take a much longer trip to enjoy and explore. I would like the start and finish to be the same (Amsterdam and Crete) but I want to extend the trip out to 4-6 weeks and travel around more on the way between. I am looking to spend maybe 1-3 days in a few different destinations between.  A little background, she was born in W√ºrzburg, but moved to the states at a young age. She traveled back to see family and would travel to a lot of the major attractions like Neuschwanstein Castle, Venice, Paris, and many many more. She loves quieter areas where we aren‚Äôt completely shoulder to shoulder with people all day, historically significant places, and fantastic food (who doesn‚Äôt). She has repeatedly told me she does not want to focus on just the romantic cities but would rather get out and do the less touristy adventures.   I am born and raised in Alaska, I‚Äôve never been out of the country, except a week trip to Baja California, Mexico which really barely counts. I have explored around the US a good amount with my new wife, we‚Äôve been up and down the east coast finding the best food and attractions we could. In search of Fossils and national parks we traveled to the Deserts of Utah, California, Nevada, and Arizona. I love finding the hidden gem/ hole in the wall places to get a bite to eat (almost always the best food), exploring cultural and natural history museums, and getting to witness stunning architecture.   I can not wait to visit your beautiful and storied continent and I hope I can at least put a small dent in the ocean of places to see. Thank you for any tips or recommendations and I hope this surprise honeymoon will be completely unforgettable."

,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-21 16:01:51 UTC,7,"Amsterdam was definitely a spot that was going to be crowded but I think with the density of interesting museums and the Tulip fields on top of that, it was a trade off I was willing to make. It is also why I picked shoulder season for Crete so we could end our trip a little more relaxed and with less people. The Spain/Portugal idea sounds fantastic and I‚Äôll have to look into that.

Berlin and London I always want to back to because there are always new things to see, but Amsterdam is more‚Ä¶ well, it is what it is. Plus, it‚Äôs quite touristy.

What cities have canals that look similar to Amsterdam? I've been to Venice, Bruges, Annecy, and Copenhagen... they are all lovely, but don't look anything like Amsterdam IMO.   I agree about London. It has endless things to do, and I could live there. One of the best cities in the world.  Maybe I am missing something, but I didn't care for Berlin.

I was so confused when I went there (which yes, was because there was a direct flight and I figured why not... so maybe not the best judge haha)  Everything is expensive, a lot of it feels... artificial? Or designed for tourists in a way that even very touristy other places do not to me. The food also wasn't great, but I regret not getting a chance to try Indonesian because I've heard that's where it shines. People were nice and the architecture is beautiful but I just didn't get the magic or overall appeal.  I know so many Americans who love Amsterdam. I think it's a combo: very accessible if you're English speaking, infatuation with (in some cases 1st exposure to) well-designed public transit and biking system, drinking / drug use permissible / encouraged trifecta.  I'm happy for them but also happy for me that I fell in love with other destinations and can skip any returns to this one."

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, Amsterdam is nice, but there are other cities that are more vibrant. I wouldn‚Äôt have Amsterdam as the one place not to miss in Europe. It feels a bit like a museum."
,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-21 16:51:47 UTC,0,"Don't go to Amsterdam and definitely not during kingsday if you enjoy quieter places. It really isn't worth it. I would recommend to avoid kingsday if possible or spend it in the countryside. Utrecht, the Hague, Maastricht are all awesome cities. There is many more cities like Utrecht that have the Amsterdam grachten vibe without the massive tourist crowds. From most places you can still conviently travel to Amsterdam by train for a day of there certain things you want to do like musea.  Places you can stay in ""the country side"" could be Volendam/Marken/Enkhuizen/Hoorn/Edam/Broek-in-waterland area. Rent some bicycles do sightseeing. Many of this places still have very interesting musea like Zuiderzee museum or places to go while being well connected to Amsterdam.  Please note that Tulip fields in general Arent really something to see. They are more in the areas mentioned, but they are crops on farmers land and just walking through them is not appreciated. Tourist ruining crops result in the farmers mowing down the tulips and then everyone loses. There will be custom tourist spots but they are simply just that; tourist traps."

There are incredible historical landmarks like the Mezquita and the Alhambra (quite different from what you'll find in the rest of Europe, because of the Moorish legacy), great nature/hiking, beaches (some highly commercialized resort areas but not all of it), excellent food, distinctive culture (e.g., flamenco), moderate costs, and excellent high-speed rail connections. Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada, and Ronda, for starters. Ronda in particular strikes me as a very romantic place. And lots of wonderful towns to explore like Vejer, Arcos, Setenil de las Bodegas (google for pics of this), Grazalema, Zahara de la Sierra, and more.  I'd recommend putting this on the front end of your trip, April is perfect, in May it can get hot especially inland."

I don't think Amsterdam and Kings Day is a worth doing. The poppy fields etc - give that a miss.   You have time to do a little bit of travelling, but I would use your extended holiday to dedicate a big chunk to settling in one place and just enjoy it. Holiday like a European couple does - spend a full week or 10 days somewhere, hang out, drink coffee, drink wine, try the various restaurants and bars, check out the local beaches, read a book, drive around to nearby towns.   I agree with the suggestion to rent a villa somewhere and a car.   Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece (in no particular order) are all great countries for this. Just pick a villa somewhere and soak it up.   Do some local hiking, take a train somewhere for a day trip.   Try the Costa Brava, the Basque Region, South West France or Provence. During my last trip to Italy I went into the hills an hour north of Rome and felt like I had travelled back in time. I swam in a volcanic lake and ate great food at the lake beach.    Go to the lesser visited cities by Americans - Valencia, Seville (incredible), Bordeaux, Bologna.   Visit some vineyards, rent some bicycles,   Don't feel you need to 'do Europe' in one trip, that would be the equivalent of me vacationing in the US and going New York &gt; Chicago &gt; LA &gt; Disney World on one holiday.

,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-22 07:03:27 UTC,1,"Iceland is on the list for a hiking trip but she specifically requested warm weather, I think I‚Äôll get a pass if is not super warm but we get to explore fields of tulips. I figured ending in Greece, or now Spain / Portugal, is a very safe bet that time of year. Austria is a whole trip she‚Äôs planning for the future because she‚Äôs spent tons of time there and the surrounding areas as a kid and she wants to take me to all of her favorite childhood destinations. I do appreciate the ideas though."

You might also, if you are going to Crete, consider taking a ferry to Santorini and staying in Santorini for a few nights.  Oia is beautiful, and Kamari and White Beach on the opposite end of Santorini are both beautiful as well.  Also, for Crete I found a cooking class on a mountain farm near Chania theough trip advisor that was a great experience"
,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-22 14:28:44 UTC,2,"You could do a bit of island hopping in Greece. There are ferries connecting different islands. Greek islands are marvelously different. You could start in Amsterdam, fly to Athens and start your journey from there exploring the the Cyclades, the Ionian Islands or the Dodecanese."

And you have an extensive amount of time to explore at least a small part of it.   I think 4-6 weeks would actually be perfect for island hopping in Greece. Getting from one island to the next will take a bit of time. Also the weather should be perfect in April /May - not too hot, not too cold. If you want to look further into it you could get the Lonely Planet Travel Guide about Greece. They have outlined a couple of possible routes."
,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-21 15:59:19 UTC,3,"As someone from Amsterdam, it is a very overcrowded city, and you‚Äôre looking at what are possibly the worst times to visit if you want peace and quiet. It‚Äôs not a very romantic destination, but if you aim to end your honeymoon with a bang, King‚Äôs day would def check that box.   I second what another person suggested ‚Äî renting a car in Crete should be straightforward and makes for a wonderful self-paced vacation. There are also lots of resorts there, if you want to go the all-inclusive route for a few days.   You could also consider checking out the south of Italy or in Spain. Lots of gems to find, amazing food, and great weather during the time period you‚Äôre looking at. :)"

So totally agree with you."
,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-21 16:16:27 UTC,2,"I would suggest doing a trip between Italy, Iberia (Spain and Portugal), or unknown parts of Europe, since it's your honeymoon, and we all know what happens on honeymoons. I would suggest privacy places and maybe Eastern Europe, which is pretty unknown but beautiful. The best places are maybe Bulgaria and Greece. Another great trip would be going around a ton of Greek islands: beautiful sea, relax, and privacy for your stuff. From what i can gather you live in Alaska and for basically anyone of those trips you can take a flight from Anchorage to Chicago and then go to Athens, Milan, Lisbon and probably more. Have fun!"

They even got to celebrate Kings day! April is beautiful in Crete, but it is still a bit early for beach/swimming‚Ä¶ you could get some beautiful weather to relax. There are some amazing properties there‚Ä¶ I would definitely get a heated plunge pool!"
,comment,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,Amsterdam; Mexico; Paris; Venice,2025-07-21 19:02:19 UTC,1,"I am a great believer in both picking and choosing a very limited number of things in one place over a short period and also immersing yourself more fully if you are staying somewhere for a longer period.  If you are going to pick two totally different, but unique things to do in Amsterdam then a visit to the Tulip fields and Kings Day are both great ideas, maybe slot in a museum, then leave.  Crete is a beautiful island, if you are there for a week I suggest you base yourselves in Chania, around the Venetian harbour and do not miss out on doing the Samaria Gorge walk.  Join a small group tour, don't try to do it on your own.  You set off by road starting the walk high up in the mountains at break of dawn and around 7 hours later you end up on a beach for a well deserved swim and a boat ride back to your coach, or if you ended up with a group of people you clicked with, dinner and dancing on the beach and figure out how you get home a lot later!  You have all of Europe in between those bookends, don't try to cram in too much. Pick and choose carefully, if you don't want it to end up a drive by and tick box experience.  I suggest you base yourselves in historic cities close to water, nature and day trips that are walkable, have good public transport links and have enough to do to keep you amused/interested for a week.  Any less than that soon becomes a chore as packing, travelling and unpacking takes most of a day, is tiring and eats into your holiday time.  First of all, ask your wife if there is somewhere she has been before that she would like to spend time with you and show you around.  She gets to pick one place and the rest is a surprise.  As u/TrampAbroad2000 said Andalusia is a great option.  Base yourselves in Malaga.  It is beautiful and has a ton of history.  Yes, there are parts that can be crowded, but you can easily escape the crowds just by walking a few streets away or taking a walk along the beach promenades, or a short bus/train trip to somewhere less touristy, but still interesting and close enough for day trips to lots of surrounding areas.  You can easily get around without a car if you book small group day trips to places outside of Malaga. Wonderful food at all price points.  It is also close to one of only 3 marine caves in the world - Cueva del Tesoro. If you love seafood and theatre you need to go to El Tintero for lunch, but only on a Saturday or Sunday.  Lisbon is another great city.  Much like Malaga in terms of history, ease of transport, walkability and food options.  It also has hills, lots of hills and a massive river with lots of things happening on it and by it and is really affordable.  Hamburg, often described as the Venice of the north for its waterways.  Remarkable for how it managed to rebuild after WWII.  The fish market is not to be missed.  Budapest, historic, romantic, has a river that divides the city, a bit grand, a bit shabby chic and when was the last time you went to a ruin bar? or stayed somewhere that looked like Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel? or drank Tokaji wine without having to order it online as opposed to buying it from the local corner shop?  I live in London and love it, but a bit like NYC, Paris, Venice, Rome, Berlin I think its a bit too obvious for your wife."

It is stressful to even cross the street with all of the bikes everywhere and the bikes having right of way. The canals are really pretty, but you can scarcely sit by the canals unless you know the area well enough; there are bike racks all along the canals. I went last summer and it was pretty stressful. I‚Äôm sure for people who know the city really well they can find all the quiet, beautiful spots, but even as a tourist who does some research, I don‚Äôt think it is going to feel like a romantic private corner of the world. Hopefully for future trips, she will be willing to go to some of the major cities in the world with you because you have not been to them and the museums in places like Paris in Florence I think you would probably like to experience in your lifetime. My two cents as well is for a romantic trip, it is better not to have too many destinations and to have to keep changing hotels- unless you two particularly want more like a road trip. Is the expectation that you have to surprise her with the trip? It sounds like she is fairly particular regarding travel so you are probably better off if she is willing to provide you feedback on some of your ideas or plan it together. If you have to guess, and you guess wrong, she may be devastated just because of all the buildup of expectations. Maybe she would love to see the flower fields in Madeira instead or maybe she has never done the south of France or the Swiss Alps, or Portugal- she has traveled so much, if she wants to do something she hasn‚Äôt done before, it‚Äôs best if she weighs in, even if you do the bulk of the planning."

Keen for honest feedback! Hey everyone, My partner and I (both early 20s from Australia) are doing one big Europe trip together ‚Äî this will likely be our only major international adventure, so we‚Äôre trying to make it count. We‚Äôve built a 36-day itinerary that mixes city life, nature, romance, food, and culture.  Here‚Äôs the breakdown:  ‚∏ª  *üìç London ‚Äì 4 nights Start of the trip. We‚Äôll catch a Chelsea game and soak in the city vibes.  *üìç Edinburgh ‚Äì 3 nights Love the dark, moody atmosphere. Planning to explore the old town, castle, and some spooky historical tours.  üìç Scottish Highlands ‚Äì 3 nights Nature adventure tour, possibly with Rabbie‚Äôs or similar. Hoping to see Glencoe, Loch Ness, and Isle of Skye vibes.  *üìç Back to Edinburgh ‚Äì 1 night A chill reset before flying to mainland Europe.  *üìç Paris ‚Äì 5 nights Romantic vibe, iconic sights, caf√©s, and food. Want to do a mix of walking tours and relaxed exploring.  *üìç Munich ‚Äì 5 nights German culture, food, and some day trips ‚Äî maybe Neuschwanstein or Dachau.  *üìç Lauterbrunnen (Switzerland) ‚Äì 6 nights A big focus for us. This is our nature hub: hiking, waterfalls, alpine villages, and just switching off. We want to base ourselves here and explore the Jungfrau region.  *üìç Rome ‚Äì 9 nights Ending with lots of food tours, markets, cooking classes, and slower exploration. We want to soak in the vibe without rushing.   Also we will be going to every place by train except from Edinburgh to Paris as my partner gets sick on flights.  Thank you for taking the time to read üòÑ  EDIT:  Thank you everyone so much I can‚Äôt stress how much your input has helped me!!  Here‚Äôs the new and improved itinerary   üìç Edinburgh ‚Äì 3 nights  üìç Scottish Highlands ‚Äì 5 nights   üìç London ‚Äì 4 nights  *üìç Paris ‚Äì 5 nights  *üìç Munich ‚Äì 3 nights  *üìçSalzburg- 3 nights  *üìç Lauterbrunnen (Switzerland) ‚Äì 6 nights  *üìç Rome ‚Äì 6 nights  So we are now flying into Edinburgh then we‚Äôll drive ourselves through the highlands finishing at iverness where we‚Äôll take the sleeper train to London.  We have reduced Rome and Munich to add Salzburg which is perfectly on route between Munich and lauterbrunnen and we added time in the Scottish highlands. I also want to mention that in Paris, Rome and Lauterbrunnen we will be having day trips to other places around the city/towns hence the extra time. Again thank you everyone so much and if you still think I can adjust it please let me know !!"

The first half of the trip is fine, but I would be so bored with the second half.  Munich only needs a couple of days (I've been there several times). Rome 4 days max (ok other people might think more - but it's touristy AF and how many churches &amp; roman sites do you need to see?). If you're doing the hiking and sightseeing in Switzerland then you can definitely keep yourself busy with exploring.  Perhaps you could insert another city or two in the second half of the trip? Lyon or Bologna, Florence, Siena? Personally, with that much time, I would probably rent a car in Italy and do my own exploring.  Edit: - I had to add this:  ""5 nights German culture, food...""  Mate, it's obvious you've never eaten German food haha. Munich is a very beautiful city, with fantastic parks and beer gardens. A little bit of interesting WW2 history. But it doesn't need much time and there's only so much schnitzel &amp; pork knuckle a non-German can take. It's usually necessary to switch to at least one kebab per day."

Depending on preferences it could be Milan, Venice, Bologna, Florence or some combination of.  Alternative to consider is also extending your stay in London. Probably the city in Europe with the most to do and an extra night or two could make a difference."

My favourite are the dolomites. Slovenia, Poland, Slovakia are also nice for mountains. I'm Australian too, have been to Switzerland and most of the people I know that have been to Switzerland were disappointed. A lot of the time, the train to a hike was like $100 return and the food in lauterbrunnen is limited, expensive and not very good. It is just an alpine country, it's no more beautiful than the others. The only thing it has is the waterfalls in the valley town."

Do a morning in Locarno, and then hop a train after lunch to Como or any of the towns along Lake Como and stay there for a night. It's a different vibe and scenery than you'll see in Rome, and since you mentioned being into nature, I think you'd enjoy your time here vs Milan.  The train rides in this region are spectacular; a travel highlight in and of themselves. I spent 3 weeks in Switzerland just riding trains and I never got sick of riding through the Alps and all the spectacular views from their panoramic cars (full glass ceilings). The trains throughout Europe are great. Consider getting a rail pass, or plan to do day trips via train; it's efficient, cost effective, and a very pleasant time.   For a once in a lifetime trip, I'd recommend breaking up your 9 days in Italy with some time spent in Tuscany or somewhere South. 1 day in Como, 4 days in Rome, 4 days in Florence, for example. Or, Venice is definitely worth seeing.   Enjoy!"

You could even get to Florence (&lt;40 mins by train each way) - yes it deserves more than a day trip, but a day trip to see the Uffizi is better than not seeing it.  Munich: I think it's highly overrated. It's nice enough but not especially interesting, and it's far from one of the great repositories of German culture.

Your itinerary looks good. You could potentially drop Rome down to 4 or 5 days and maybe try for Florence and/or Venice as well. They were incredible places, but you also can't go wrong with Rome. If it interests you, you can rent ebikes and ride the roman road, which was straight out of a movie.  Some general advice, try and take some pressure off yourselves, it may not be your only European holiday. We thought the same a couple of years ago, but went back the following year and planning another 2 more trips over the next 6 years (finances pending!). We took our kids which introduced a bit of stress anyway, but we were also a little stressed thinking we had to squeeze every moment out of the trip as it would be our only shot. If you can, try to relax and just go with the flow. Things will definitely not go to plan sometimes! Thats half the fun. Plus, you're in your 20's....plenty of time to revisit or explore further the countries that really stood out to you."

If you get a chance in Edinburgh, do the Leith walk. I came across it because I went to Hearts' ground and walked on to Dean Village.

In my experience it gets quite exhausting to constantly be sightseeing in major cities. Rome is amazing but I wouldn‚Äôt spend my only 9 days in Italy there. In my opinion one of the best parts of Italy is its countryside.   Why not hire a car and spend a week in an agriturismo in Tuscany? That way you can visit a bunch of amazing cities/towns and also take some time to relax when you need it. I would even take some days off my time in Paris and/or Munich for this."

My colleague is in italy now walking it. Or alternatively in the Dolomites and do day hikes.    What month will you be travelling?  Summer in Rome js hot and humid.  I was there in may which was really nice.  Check out the catacombs in paris. Walk along the southbank of the thames in london from westminster to tower bridge; and along the regents canal along the northern suburbs.

None of them have stereotypical timber frame houses, in case you were looking for that.   Neuschwanstein is a kitsch tourist trap, a late 19th century hilltop mansion cosplaying as a medieval castle.

And although the castle is kitch, it is still beatiful together with the surroundings. You can connect it with the Wieskirche.  Other nice day trips would be Garmisch/Oberammergau/Ettal (Monastery)/Linderhof (another, smaller castle from King Ludwig) or to Berchtesgaden/K√∂nigssee (you can skip the Eagles Nest).  Regensburg is a possible day trip as well as Salzburg.  Overall the trip looks nice and totally doable."

Will be a good bit warmer and brighter in late May for Scotland, and Rome will have gotten hot by then, so might be better to swap them. Remember that flights are very cheap and quick between European cities so you don't need to really adhere to a linear progression from west to east, you can bounce around Europe easily enough. I guess the Chelsea match is the only thing that's time dependent.   Also get yourself to the beach in Italy. Consider taking a train to Naples, seeing Pompeii and visiting Ischia or Capri or Sorrento or something. You'll have been in cities for weeks at that point and you'll need to cool off!

If booked in advance it's not expensive. You could also choose other places on the same route, like Lille or Brussels or Antwerp, all nice cities (I'm biased as I live in Antwerp). Lille and Antwerp are quite beautiful and easy to get around and just need a few days, Brussels is massive, so might need a bit more time. All three have nice food and wine/beer, depending on your interest, and history and art as well and nightlife if you want. Super walkable.   Paris is nice but maybe 3 or 4 days is enough, and then you can see other places. Especially if you're on the train, you can easily stop along the way. If you're not dead set on Munich, Lyon is super nice for food and culture. People talk shit about the people, but we had nothing but great interactions. Are you going in the summer? Annecy is beautiful.   I have a soft spot for Rome, but if your up for spending a few days somewhere else, why not the Cinque Terre. Or Genoa? The beauty of traveling by train is you can easily visit smaller cities/towns. Or do some day trips from Rome, like Ostia or Tivoli. You can't go wrong in any Italian city for food and wine, so you can really stay anywhere.   Are these cities chosen for a particular reason or just trying to get in the main ones? A combo of nature and cities? Are you looking to party or are you looking for a more chill time? Into history and art? That helps narrow down the best fit.   I did a trip like this in my 20s - we had ideas of where we wanted to go but sometimes we met people along the way and changed the itinerary on the fly. There were some places I needed to see, but also places I never would have seen if not for the suggestions of others.   Enjoy your amazing vacation!"

I would suggest one change. In Rome you don't seem to be interested in museums and archaeology, so 9 days is really a lot even if you visit all the main attractions.

Both offer different vibes and food experience than Rome. Verona has the bonus of having Juliet balcony and the Arena."

I spent a month in London last July and I'm currently back there again. There's so much to see. Yesterday I went to the Moco Museum, which I hadn't even heard of before, and loved it. Someone just told me about The Postal Museum and its underground network, so I'm going to do that on my next visit as it sounds fascinating. If you want to stay in Italy, I think a few days in Rome is enough, then see if you can go to Matera and Alberobello in the south. The conical houses (trulli) are a must-see IMO.

It was great! But 3 nights in Edinburgh seems a bit much. I think 2 full days are sufficient for Edinburgh. Half a day for the castle, the rest of the day for the royal mile and new town. Dean Village (as suggested in blogs) was not worth the time - skip it. On the 2nd day the National Gallery if you like art (we do) and exlploring more of the town. You can do a ghost tour through the cemetery or walk up to the Carlton(?) Hill - only if there is good weather."

It is not a romantic city, it smells like pee, but there is still a lot to do if you're interested in art and history. The only way for Australians to enjoy Paris is to come with low expectations, otherwise you will be disappointed. Actually romantic places in Europe would be the french countryside, especially south around Provence. The Italian lakes in the north are also romantic if you want to cut from Rome as 9 days is a lot. Especially if you go in like July or August, it'll be boiling in land locked Rome. I'd recommend 5 days in Rome. Lake Como is very popular and beautiful, romantic but obviously more busy. Lake Garda is also pretty and a little less busy, and has more Italians. These are places you can relax with a loved one, not Paris where there's filth and crime all over the place. Florence is a beautiful city nearby Rome worth a few nights. It's part of the Tuscany region which many consider romantic. You can rent a car here, it's a pretty easy place to drive. I had allergies there so it was not romantic for me lol, but it was still very pretty and peaceful. Munich also does not have much to do. The nature in the Berchtesgaden region which is south of Munich is quite nice. I have been to Munich multiple times and it's only ever because of flight connections or practicality reasons.   I think people are reluctant to listen to suggestions to places that aren't the big names everybody knows, but then they all come home disappointed and complain how Europe wasn't as nice as they expected. Prague, Krakow and Budapest are cities you should look into. They're easily connected by trains. Prague is the most touristy and my least favourite, but others seem to love it. It is a shame to go to Europe once and only visit the centre."

Every place you are visiting is totally worth it and beautiful.

I've got the bookend cities, but I'm stuck on what to do in the middle. We plan to fly into London (where we've been several times), then go Paris via train. Then something between Paris and a few cities in Italy (Venice, Florence, and Rome primarily), finally flying out of Rome. But all the trains between Paris and Italy are fairly long journeys (8-10+ hours), so I'm looking for a good city to stop at for a day or two. Maybe Geneva for the lake, but those are still pretty long train rides. We've already been to several cities in Belgium and Germany, and I would like to go somewhere new. Since I loathe CDG airport, I would prefer not to fly Paris to Italy. Any recommendations for cities between Paris and Italy that are serviced by high speed rail and interesting to see?

5,post,Prague; Regensburg; Salzburg; United States,Prague; Regensburg; Salzburg; United States,2025-07-09 01:51:03 UTC,4,"Should I Just Skip Prague Given This Situation I Stupidly Got Into? This sub has already saved me from making some terrible itinerary mistakes as our family of four (including two kids, ages 7 and 11) plan their their first trip overseas from the United States in October. I think I have almost all of the avoidable kinks worked out of our plan except for one:  Here's the situation: to get home, our current plan has us flying from Prague to Frankfurt and then catching a connection back to the States a mere 100 minutes after landing in Frankfurt. To make matters worse, the two flights are on different airlines (Prague to Frankfurt is Condor; Frankfurt to USA is Lufthansa/Discover). So, in order to make our connection, we not only need our first flight to depart on time, we also need to claim our bags at baggage claim (which at Frankfurt can reportedly take at least an hour sometimes), physically check our bags at the second flight's counter, and then make it to our second flight. It seems like an almost impossible proposition.  Since the flights are on two different airlines, I assume if we miss the second flight, the airline will not feel an obligation to get us to our final destination and we might therefore have to pay for brand new tickets, might be forced to stay an extra unplanned night or two, etc. This would all occur at the point when our kids are at peak exhaustion and it just seems like a terrible idea (yes, I realize I'm an idiot for not realizing this earlier!)  As such, I'm thinking about a few different options:  ***Option #1 - Try to find an earlier flight.*** I‚Äôd have to pay change fees, would have to basically get up at like 2 AM the night before, which would largely defeat the purpose of staying in Prague the night before, would have to stress about getting to the airport on time in the middle of the night, etc. This seems like a recipe for disaster.  ***Option #2*** ***-*** ***Take a train to Frankfurt a day earlier***. We‚Äôd have the morning in Prague, but would then spend a ton of time on the train. We‚Äôd have a stressless time of catching our flight the next day but we would be sort of throwing away a night in Prague. I‚Äôd also be throwing away the nonrefundable plane ticket cost from Prague to Frankfurt. This is only about $400 so it‚Äôs not the end of the world if we have to do that, but still.  **Option #3 - Skip Prague entirely and go somewhere else.** If we were going to do Option #2, we‚Äôd have one evening, a full day, and then a half of another day in Prague, which isn‚Äôt that much. Our  Prague stop is at the very end of our trip and we plan to more or less stay in the city center and not do any day trips so our activities will be confined to a compact area. Given this, perhaps this amount of time might be enough, but I could also argue that if we‚Äôre going to be here for such a short time it doesn‚Äôt justify the considerable amount of time we will have to spend traveling from Salzburg to Prague and then getting back to Frankfurt. Everything about our trip to Prague is refundable except for that $400 flight to Frankfurt. Maybe we just save Prague for another trip and instead spend a couple of days in Regensburg, Rothenburg, or N√ºrnberg. Doing this would save us a lot of travel time and would be so much more chill.     I'd be curious to know (1) what you think our chances are of making that second flight if we stay with that plan; (2) what any of you think about any of the options above; and (3) anything else you have to say. Yes, I know: I'm an idiot. Thank you in advance!"
,comment,Prague; Regensburg; Salzburg; United States,Prague; Regensburg; Salzburg; United States,2025-07-09 01:56:57 UTC,55,A 100 minute international connection with self transfer and checked bags and kids in tow is very risky.  Skip Prague - but hear me out. Visit Prague and Budapest or similar on a different trip. Prague is worth several days on its own.

,comment,Prague; Regensburg; Salzburg; United States,Prague; Regensburg; Salzburg; United States,2025-07-09 08:14:53 UTC,9,"It's not about the different airlines. It's about how they are ticketed. Condor and Lufthansa have a relationship that I can best describe as ""it's complicated"" (https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-order-lufthansa-restore-condors-access-its-short-haul-network-2025-01-15/).  If you have a single through ticket then they will check your bags through and they will be responsible for a new flight. Obviously a connection is always more riskier then a direct flight but it should be fine and you don't be out of pocket.  But even if on the same airline you have two different tickets then that isn't applicable and you are still making a self transfer.  I think you have broadly covered your options. Personally I don't think the 100 minute self transfer with bags and immigration is even remotely worth considering at all. Prague is a large detour between Salzburg and Frankfurt for very little time there. I think getting the train and going to places like Regensburg, Rothenburg, or N√ºnberg is the best option. Or depending how long you are staying in Salzburg spend some more time there and look into some day trips.  If you are traveling to Frankfurt airport for the purposes of a flight by train you can get some discounted train tickets: https://www.lufthansa.com/gb/en/rail-and-fly"

There is no process for tight connections, and airport staff don't care. If you haven't booked tickets yet, always choose AMS if you need to go through passport control. They have screens listing flight times, and if you need to get through quickly you show staff your boarding pass to get into the express line.   I can not recommend relying on German trains to get anywhere on time either. Czech trains are fine. If you fly out of Berlin, sure, take the train from Prague. Deutsche Bahn to Frankfurt?

But it is an intermediate stop on the line from Prague to Zurich. The train stops in Frankfurt South (not the main station) at 0338!  If you don't mind an early start and depending on specific times you could do something like continue to Karlsruhe (0507) or Freiburg (0617) and double back. With the added bonus that if there is any delay you can get off earlier.  The times do very depending on exact dates and it often sells out. It normally leaves Prague at 1828 and has a restaurant carriage for your evening meal.  There is also a night train from Linz to Mainz (Vienna to Brussels) but it only runs 3 times a week. You can easily connect from Prague though would need to leave around 1420. It is due into Mainz at 0545, and you could do something similar like stay on to Bonn (0631).

And every day you switch cities is basically a lost travel day.   It's not just the time on the train or plane, but also checking in and out of hotels, getting to and from airports or train stations, and finding your way around a new city.  For example: (kilometer distances are estimated, not exact.)  * The distance between Amsterdam and Lausanne is about 850 kilometers (530 miles). By train it takes around 7 to 8 hours, and by plane 5 to 6 hours total, including airport time and the transfer from Geneva to Lausanne. * The distance between Lausanne and Barcelona is about 900 kilometers (560 miles). By train it's at least 9 to 10 hours, often with one or two changes. Flying takes 5 to 6 hours total. * The distance between Lausanne and Madrid is around 1,200 kilometers (745 miles). Train travel can take over 11 hours, while flying is about 5 to 6.5 hours door to door.  So just keep in mind that each city change is more than just travel time ‚Äì it's often a full day of your trip."

You could save one night in a hotel and travel while sleeping.   In Switzerland, I recommend Lucerne rather than Lausanne. You‚Äôll be closer to the big mountains. And it‚Äôs easier to get there from Basel - only one hour by train.   Afterwards you can fly directly to Barcelona from Basel or Zurich"

,comment,Amsterdam; Baltimore; Barcelona; Lausanne; Madrid; Valencia,Amsterdam; Baltimore; Barcelona; Lausanne; Madrid; Valencia,2025-07-16 13:07:21 UTC,2,"I second this - Lausanne is not a destination for what OP wants. Lucerne is lovely but the main draw is the Swiss alps and for that the gold standard is the Jungfrau region, aka Interlaken. Better base locations for the area are Brienz and Meiringen for day trips to Kandersteg and Lauterbrunnen etc. Interlaken, Brienz, Meiringen can all easily be reached from both Basel and Zurich. Switzerland has fantastic public transit.   Other incredible regions are Engadin to the east with Zernez or Flims or St Moritz as a base or the Zermatt area, but these are both further afield.   I've lived in Switzerland for 14 years :)"

Switzerland is beautiful but the alps also stretch into France, Germany, Austria, Italy and these parts are not so extremely expensive to visit, but these areas are never in anyone's itineraries. I regularly see people planning to go from Paris to Interlaken when they could stay in France and visit some amazing places. I guess it's probably down to not being as familiar with Europe.  If you plan on going to Spain, you could maybe try some hiking in the Pyrenees Mountains? These are at the border between France and Spain, not so far from Barcelona and you can reach them by train.  Just to emphasise again - Switzerland is crazy expensive"

Going between places like  rome and Florence were only like 2 hours, so try to take an early train so your day isn't shot. We tried to book all of our places close to the train station, so it wasn't a hard walk with our bags. Even then, we learned public transit is your friend even with suitcases. We wasted $40 on Uber in Paris because we didn't know better, but when we left, it was like $2.50‚Ç¨ Took the metro right to the train station. Same price from our hotel all the way to Paris Disney, and it drops you right at the gate. You can almost go anywhere in europe metro areas on public transit busses/trams/metros.

Pick one country! Just one. Maybe one week in a city and one week at sea or countryside.  When you are in Amsterdam you can go to other cities by train . Under an hour are Leiden, Haarlem, Delft, The Hague, Utrecht and many more. You can take a train to go to the seaside. You can also do loads of hiking if that‚Äôs your thing.   Doing Europe and only picking a couple of big cities is seeing not a lot of Europe.   I also find it hard to pick one destination. So in Denmark we did 6 days seaside, 6 days Copenhagen and 3 days waterpark.  I‚Äôm in Italy right now and we had one week in Rome and the second week we are at the seaside."

,comment,Amsterdam; Baltimore; Barcelona; Lausanne; Madrid; Valencia,Amsterdam; Baltimore; Barcelona; Lausanne; Madrid; Valencia,2025-07-16 16:33:12 UTC,1,Fly to Copenhagen. Book 2-3 days there. Sweden is only a 20 min train ride. U can visit Sweden for 1 day. Then from Copenhagen take a train to Berlin. Those 2 cities are a must for a euro trip. From Berlin take a train to Amsterdam. I can at least give those locations. Rest is up to you but you should not spend your time on trains all the time. To many cities means your vacation will be spent on trains.

Plan a trip assuming you‚Äôll go back to Europe. If you clog all your time off between trains and plains and relocating countries. If you know you want to visit Amsterdam in particular, then plan a trip there and research a few day trips (Rick Steves is a good resource for locating fantastic small towns around larger tourist cities). Or if you‚Äôre just *dying* to pack in more countries, fly into Amsterdam and plan a way to fly out of Copenhagen; Helsinki, or Brussels, with plenty of buffer to enjoy those cities too."

I have a budget of USD 2500 including flights for 14-15 days. I am confused between Poland or Portugal in October. First time visiting Europe. I was thinking to do a trip through G Adventures - but they seem too expensive. I am not a hostel-dorm kind of a person - though wouldn't mind a room in a hostel. My questions are as follows:  1. Which is more solo female friendly?  2. Is it safe to travel Poland or Portugal without a group?  3. Are 14-15 days enough for either Portugal or Poland or less? Should I visit 2 countries?  3.

,comment,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,2025-06-30 13:08:36 UTC,12,"Portugal! I went to Portugal as a 24F in November and it was my *favorite* place I've ever visited. I was with a partner, but I loved it and never felt unsafe. The cities are beautiful and have authentic charm, the food and wine were fantastic, the weather was great, everyone was friendly, and it was easy to get by with English. It was also pretty cheap, at least by US standards.  With 14 days, I would do something like: - 4-5 nights in Porto with day trips to the Douro Valley and Braga (could also stay overnight in Braga) - 1-2 nights in Coimbra (a small university city that is stunning and charming) - A few hours stop in Fatima if you are interested in the lore - 1-2 nights in Evora or Nazare or Aviero - 4-5 nights in Lisbon with a day trip to Sintra and a mini day trip to Belem - the Algarve, but I didn't go here so idk how much time to spend (sorry)  Fly into Porto and out of Lisbon, or vice versa. If you can.   One of the best things about Portugal is that it is small, so you can get just about anywhere on the train in an hour or two, and you won't waste a ton of time traveling.  There will be some sketchy-looking guys trying to sell you ""hashish"" in the tourist areas, but they are just annoying and won't harm you.   Porto is my favorite city ever. I long to go back there! I saw/did some cool things in Lisbon, but I didn't like it near as much. I'd be happy to give more advice :)"

You may have to stay at Hostels for some of the trip, you easily can grab some fresh fruit, tomatoes and cucumbers and meats and cheese plus bread from the supermarkets. Beer and wine is cheap.

,comment,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,2025-06-30 17:29:21 UTC,2,"You don't need to drive to have a great time in Portugal. I took only trains and other public transport and it was easy and cheap.   You can do the rest of Portugal cheap as well. Use google flights to find the cheapest flights and fly on cheaper days (weekdays instead of weekends) if you can. Spend less time in Lisbon and more time in Porto or the smaller cities, since they are cheaper (I liked them better anyways). Stay a bit out of the center and take the metro in. Look for places with private rooms but shared bathrooms.   For food: A pastel de nata + espresso for breakfast will only be like 3 euro, bifana sandwiches are cheap and make a delicious lunch or dinner, you can get a great bottle of wine and some good meat and cheese from the supermarket for cheap and have a nice picnic meal at one of the miradouros. A glass of port wine at a bar in Porto should be less than 5‚Ç¨.   For attractions: Portugal is freaking beautiful and you don't need to buy entrance tickets into all of the attractions to have an enjoyable time. Exploring the ticketed castles in Sintra was awesome, but I had just as much fun strolling the free streets in Alfama or nursing a cheap glass of port wine over a pretty view in Porto. Portugal also has lots of great hiking and nature spots, which are free!   Depending on how much you can get your flights for, I really think you can do 2 weeks in Portugal on your budget."
,comment,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,2025-07-01 04:49:26 UTC,0,This is a great itinerary but for a first time EU solo traveller this could be overwhelming. I would stick to staying in Lisbon and Porto and day trips from both cities.

October is beautiful in Poland, with colourful leaves and not that many tourists, but it's very hit or miss - when it rains and it's cold, it's not a nice weather to be out for a long time. September would be much better. It's hard to beat Poland in terms of safety, and I've never been to Portugal solo, but everyone was really really nice, so I think it's definitely safe enough :)."

The city of Porto has some lovely views but it is really not that interesting. Lisbon is fine. Now, I would happily live in Portugal, but to keep you actively entertained for two weeks of holiday as a solo traveller, it's difficult. Especially if you aren't driving, as the whole middle of the country is difficult to experience without a car.   2. Poland is much more interesting historically but only if you are wanting to visit a lot of museums. Gdansk and Warsaw have brilliant museums on Poland's history, but if you aren't very interested in learning about the country's 20th century struggles, then it wouldn't be the best place to travel for two weeks. It has other stuff besides that ofc, but not two weeks' worth.   3. Generally I wouldn't necessarily recommend two weeks in either country unless you have a particular interest in either, or unless you have already visited half of Europe. Poland can be easily paired with another country like Germany, and Portugal can be paired with 1-2 cities in Spain easily enough, as long as you are sensible about your choices (although maybe you've been to Spain already). For instance, from Porto it is not too difficult to get to the Galicia region in Spain (which is like Portugal's little cousin), or you could fly to somewhere like Barcelona.     Both countries are perfectly safe."

Start in porto, enjoy the vino verde and all the tapas/bar small plates along with that sangria. Take a train down to Lisbon, enjoy a few of the cities like Coimbra, Braga, nazar√©, Cascais as well. Stay for a good week in Lisbon enjoy the good food and the towns around like Sintra. Head then to Algarve, rent a car, live in an off-centre Airbnb surrounded by orange orchards, make your fruit salad every day and squeeze those oranges. Enjoy the surf and the sea caves. Even more fun if you have company!  A week is not enough for Algarve. All in all you wouldn't be spending more than 2000 eurs if you plan well! Enjoy!"

We are at 9 days already. You would need a minimum of 3 days to do touristy things at Algarve, and to relax and enjoy the sea and grilled octopus add 2 more days.

,comment,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,2025-06-30 15:18:51 UTC,3,"Like many answered, Portugal would be better in October. I went to Poland in early October, and it was cold by Indian standards. If in Poland, you can easily spend 4 days in Krakow, a day trip to Auschwitz-Birkenau (it will be emotionally draining and haunting), 1-2 days in Zakopane, 2-3 days in Gdansk. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lot to see in Warsaw or Wroclaw. I spent 4 nights in total, made Krakow my base and took day trips to Auschwitz-Birkenau and Zakopane. It‚Äôs easy to combine Prague / Berlin with Poland. I had covered Prague and absolutely fell in love. I also additionally did Vienna, Hallstatt and Bratislava. Total trip was 18 days.   Can‚Äôt really comment about Portugal, coincidentally I‚Äôm planning to go this September, contingent on visa approval. But from what I researched, it‚Äôs very easy to spend 3-4 days each in Porto, Lisbon and then you can stay in other places like Algarve, Lagos, Coimbra, Cascais. Portugal is a much smaller country compared to Poland, so it might be easier for you. If you have even more time, you can cover southern Spain (Seville, Granada)."

From Katowice it is half the distance (and not much to see in Katowice ;) ).  Besides Wieliczka Salt Mine you can see of course Wawel castle, a lot of old churches around the old city. And also underground of the main square.  Go and see Wroclaw, Poznan (with Gniezno if you are interested in the first Polish capital from about 1000 years ago), Toru≈Ñ, Gda≈Ñsk."

That being said, if you're lucky, Poland can also have enjoyable weather in October. Both countries are very safe.   Poland is great though, and you should visit in the future. A trip from Krakow to Warsaw to Gdansk, for example, will bring you from the mountains in the south to the sandy beaches in the north and expose you to three unique and esthetically different cities."

Some of Europe's most incredible monuments, very enjoyable cities, excellent food, moderate costs, fast and inexpensive trains. There are obviously no guarantees for weather, but generally central and southern Spain has *extremely* nice weather in October. (Much of Portugal will be cooler and wetter because of its proximity to the Atlantic.)"
,comment,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,2025-06-30 17:35:26 UTC,3,"It depends what you mean by visiting a country. If you wanna see a few cities in each, maybe countryside, it's enough to see both. Overall I don't recommend Poland in October. Too cold here, visit between June-August for good weather. Go with Portugal in this case or maybe just go through Poland to see Warsaw + Krakow (good train connection), 1 day each and fly to Portugal from one of the cities.   Poland is overall safe, you can travel solo. Big cities are like any other big cities, don't go to weird places alone in the dark, stick to where people are and you'll be perfectly fine. I have only been to Portugal once and I also consider it a safe country. With the same issues as to the big cities, just stay reasonable about where and when you go. I wouldn't say any is more safe for a solo female, they are both fine to visit on your own. You can encounter an asshole or a robber anywhere in the world."
,comment,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,Poland; Portugal; South Korea,2025-07-01 08:43:17 UTC,3,"Two weeks seems like a lot for Portugal. The best thing about Poland is that everything is there. You have the sea, great lakes in Mazury, a historical capital with Krak√≥w, historical sights like old castles and cathedrals, mountains, nice forest trails in Kaszuby and Bory Tucholskie, beautiful port cities like Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia, nice smaller cities like Toru≈Ñ, and obviously the capital. Polish nature and culture is so diverse you could easily spend a month here and not get bored.   You're probably landing in Warsaw, so spend a couple days there. Then you could spend some time in the Tricity area by the baltic sea - 2 days for Gda≈Ñsk, 2 days for Gdynia and Sopot, and if you're interested in seeing the biggest brick castle in Europe and seeing how small towns look like then 1 day for Malbork. Maybe also the Hel peninsula if you like beaches. Then i'd head to Toru≈Ñ and spend a day there, it has a nice old town and cool museums. From there i'd head to Krak√≥w and spend 3 days there, maybe a day in Auschwitz Birkenau. You could also visit Prague from there which i'd recommend. Then you could explore the Eagle Nest Trail which takes you through ruins of old castles and fortresses between Krak√≥w and Czƒôstochowa. After that you could head to somewhere in the Tatra mountains and have fun hiking. But really feel free to pick and choose what you like. Other places like Pozna≈Ñ, Bydgoszcz, Szczecin (train to Berlin from there maybe), Wroc≈Çaw, Karkonosze are also worth visiting  As for safety Poland is one of the safest countries in Europe, you won't be bothered"

Sep/Oct is the best time to be there, fewer tourists and the weather is still great.   You will not need a car, and probably do not want a car. The public transport is great, trains between cities are cheap and also Uber is very cheap if needed.   The trains run down to Faro and head all the way East and West. It doesn‚Äôt always run down the coast but there are plenty of nice stops on the algarve on the trainline.   I would recommend Lagos, Ferragudo, Olhao and Tavira."

Hello. I have planned a trip through Europe that I am going on this summer for a week in July. I will be leaving on the 8th and need to be home before the 18th. I have already planned most of the trip and I think it looks good but I would also need some help to be realistic as I struggle with that sometimes when I plan. I should also add that this is a very budget trip and I have managed to find train and hostel for about 450 ‚Ç¨, not using Interrail-card so I cant do anything too expensive but I would still like to know if you think this is an okay route or if it is too much?  First big train trip is from Copenhagen to Mittenwald, travelling mostly during the night. My plan then is to spend the day in Mittenwald and leave in the evening on a night train to Vienna.   In Vienna I plan to stay for two days from the 10th to the 12th to see the city. Will two days be okay or should I change to only one day?  After Vienna I want to see Bratislava for one day and Prague for one day, travelling between these cities with night train too.   After Prague I have a small problem as I cant find any good train connection between Prague and Berlin which is the next city. I would like to have as much time in Prague as possible as I am only able to visit for a day but there are no good night trains between the cities. Any recommendations? I found a train connection with a 3hr. layover in Dresden in the middle of the night. Is this safe? I would prefer to change it but I dont want to lose time in any of the cities.  By my calculations I will arrive to Berlin on the 14th and spend two entire days in the city before going home again on the evening of the 16th.   I really want your input on this trip. I know it looks like a lot for a week but I am young and this is my first big European trip by myself so I think I will be fine but there are a few things you would recommend I change or skip. Thank you."

Assuming Copenhagen is only the starting point and you're not visiting it, that's still 5 locations, including 3 very large cities with a ton to see, in just one week.

,comment,Berlin; Bratislava; Copenhagen; Dresden; Prague; Vienna,Berlin; Bratislava; Copenhagen; Dresden; Prague; Vienna,2025-06-27 15:56:28 UTC,2,"Have you checked if there is any availability on the night trains?  Don't get me wrong they are a great way to travel. But they are often expensive and need to be booked far in advance. I would always say get a couchette or better, it is not worth it in the seats and you'll get no sleep. Particularly with an itinerary as far as this.  Prague to Berlin is too close for a night train really. The daytime trains don't even take 4 hours. I think you would be much better off getting an early or late train. Most of them have onboard restaurant carriages.  If you really wanted you could do something like go to Brno in the evening and get the night train from there to Berlin (which passes through Prague in the middle of the night), but it only reaches Berlin around 2 hours before the first daytime train. But I don't think it really makes sense.  Vienna to Prague there is also no night train. Again daytime trains only take around 4 hours. There is one from Bratislava to Prague but it spends several hours stationary overnight so it takes a sensible amount of time.  I really doubt this is going to be achievable with that sort of budget personally. There is no way of avoiding that moving around a lot is expensive. I would strongly consider cutting some places. Then you can have a few longer legs where night trains make more sense. Spending 3 hours in any railway station in the middle of the night absolutely isn't worth considering!  Edit: Also check for engineering work in Denmark. There are various disruptions this summer to the trains between Copenhagen and Berlin/Hamburg. The trains from Vienna to Bratislava are temporarily running to Bratislava-Petr≈æalka station to the south of the city due to engineering works not the main central station.

He is on his way back to the airport as I am writing this. We are planning to tour Hamburg(his hometown) and other parts of Germany on 1st October. I‚Äôll stay there for 2 weeks. Now that he broke up with me and won‚Äôt be with me during my stay there in Hamburg as what he told me an hour ago, and I would still want to continue my planned tour with or without him, any tips for a first timer in Germany?

,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 19:33:37 UTC,184,"Hope you're doing alright and good on you for going to Germany anyway!  First of all, as you're going in October, I would prioritise proper clothing: An underlayer (e.g. long-sleeve t-shirt), a wool jumper and a rain jacket as the outer layer. It'll be cold, wet and windy, and proper clothing is necessary to still be able to enjoy it.  I personally feel like Hamburg isn't the greatest place for sightseeing, but lovely to live in, so I always recommend tourists to pretend they live there (also, sights are easy to google). These are the things I would add to my itinerary:  * go to the Jenisch Park and the Stadtpark; they're beautiful in autumn and especially for someone from a tropical country, the colourful leaves can be a real treat * make use of the subway U3 (it has a beautiful view of the waterfront) and take a ferry (they're part of public transport and you'll get a nice view of the harbour - the waves are lovely in autumn) * watch a show at the Planetarium when the rain gets too much - it's super cosy and the shows that have you travel through the galaxy are wonderful * make use of the caf√©s in Rotherbaum, Harvestehude and Winterhude; I always think Hamburg's residential areas are its best parts, but tourists rarely go there - they're super cosy in autumn and the food and drinks are really nice * treat yourself to a dinner at the Engel restaurant; it's out on a pier and you can watch the container ships go by * take a walk around Rotherbaum, down the Milchstra√üe to the Alsterpark * go for a classical concert at the St. Michaelis church and go for a walk through the Komponistenquartier * if you want to try some super traditional food, go to the Schifferb√∂rse restaurant or the Krameramtsstuben * visit the Treppenviertel and have some cake at Caf√© Schuldt  I think the places most people feel a bit uncomfortable in Hamburg are the central station (dirty, a lot of beggars and junkies, but not dangerous, so just keep calm), the Jungfernstieg stairs by the Anleger Jungfernstieg at night (avoid it when you're alone at night - I've been molested several times, totally fine during day time, though) and the Steindamm at night. The Reeperbahn, Hamburg's party and red light district, can be uncomfortable depending on what you're used to, but I've never really felt unsafe."
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 20:07:00 UTC,39,Just to add: The view from Altonaer Balkon is amazing   If you want to get an idea of how Hamburg looked like visit what‚Äôs left of G√§ngeviertel and a bit more touristy Kr√§meramtsstuben as well as of course Speicherstadt and for example Deichstra√üe.  If you have sturdy shoes you can still go for a walk at Elbstrand   For outside Hamburg: Take the regional train to L√ºbeck. Much more old Hansestadt than Hamburg  You can also go by train to Kiel and North and Baltic Sea. Both can be quite rough if you‚Äôre not used to it but still nice.  South from Hamburg you can visit L√ºneburg or Stade.   And I can only second everything about Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. It seems dangerous but in the around 20 years I commute to it I never had any bad experience. Go straight to your public transport (U or S-Bahn) and you‚Äôre fine.

Nevertheless there is of course public transport, but the walking experience might be an interesting change.

Don't visit the Reeperbahn at night alone. You're a young woman and from the Philippines, people may think you work there.  Visit the platform up on the Elfi: by an online ticket in advance to avoid the long cues. Don't go there at weekend.  Do a walk through the old Elbe tunnel, it's free and it's amazing. You find it at the one end of the Landungsbr√ºcken. Landungsbr√ºcken is a must, there also the boat taxi will depart to go down the river. Have a visit in the church Michaelis, it's nice and calm. The 'Michel' is not far away from the Landungsbr√ºcken, and one of the famous signs of Hamburg.  Go to the Speicherstadt and have a coffee or sth. Maybe you want to visit the Miniaturwunderland. It's a model of many places in Germany and around the world. People really like it. Also the Hamburg dungeon may be fun.  Go up really early to visit the fish market.!!  Buy a tourist ticket for the public transportation, xou can easily go nearly everywhere by subway. Go to the mensa at the University. The subway station is great. And around the corner you can have a cheap good meal in the Mensa. It's not o ly for students, everybody can eat there.  Visit the stadtpark. Go shopping. Sit in a cafe. Visit the Alster lake in the centre of the city. Visit the great Rathaus right there. Have a Franzbr√∂tchen in a bakery."
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 20:33:00 UTC,4,"Sorry for your breakup! And cool that you still want to go!  I can really recommend Hamburg. More has already been said.   Are you flying in via Frankfurt?  I would recommend Fulda, it's just a nice medium sized town with a few sights and small stores, a large cathedral and an amazing daliah garden that might still be in bloom in October. Also, it's right on the fast train line from Hamburg to Frankfurt. Nice towns closer to Hamburg are Celle, Stade and L√ºbeck (on the Baltic Sea).   Bring a waterproof and windproof jacket, best with a hood, plus a scarf, and shoes that are good for walking, as you will probably do a lot of it. The wind in the North can get nasty, and rain is always possible.  Rothenburg ob der Tauber (there are several ""Rot(h)enburg""s) is what tourists imagine Germany to be. It is also full of tourists. But then, a town full of tourists might be easier to navigate when you are alone in an unknown country than one less so. You can reach it by train from Nuremberg or W√ºrzburg.   Nuremberg and W√ºrzburg could be worth a visit, too. Although they are in the federal state of Bavaria, they are not historically in the region of Bavaria (which is in is in the South and Southeast of the federal state, and which I do not know well).   Berlin is... well, Berlin. Interesting. Maybe a bit too interesting, depending on your preferences. It's still safe, unless you do something stupid (like getting drunk or involved with drugs, or not paying attention to what your backpack is doing). I never felt unsafe in Berlin, but I go there for the sights, and the shopping and my idea of ""nightlife"" is to see a show."

,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-16 07:11:16 UTC,3,"I'd recommend getting the ""DB Navigator"" app. It's the official app of the Deutsche Bahn and you can use it to find all connections and easily buy tickets. You'll get a QR code in the app when you've bought a ticket and show that when you are checked for tickets. You can choose an english layout in the app. If you choose to travel a bit and not just stay in Hamburg, I'd recommend looking into the Deutschlandticket (or 49‚Ç¨ ticket) ahead of traveling (it takes a few days to be activated!). You can buy it in the DB Navigator app. It allows you to use all local public transport (including trains!). The DB Navigator app has a setting where you can choose to only be shown local transport options, so you'll only be shown connections that suit your ticket. In general you can get anywhere with local transport, it'll just take longer than if you were using the ICEs (intercity express)."

,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 20:29:42 UTC,5,"Food for thought: If you aren't staying with him, you will need to pay for accommodation and food.  Cheapest places to stay are hostels. At a hostel you pay for a bed (usually a bunk bed) in a shared room. The room might have up to 12 or 16 other people, men and women. Don't worry, this is normally quite safe, biggest risk is having your passport and money stolen. Many hostels have lockers for your valuables, use them. Women-only dorms exist, but are generally more expensive and not always available.  Average price for a hostel bed is 20-30 EUR per night. Food bought from the supermarket will be around 10 EUR per day.  Travelling for two weeks thus means 40 EUR x14 days = 560 EUR plus 49 EUR for the Deutschland-Ticket. This is the utter minimum so that you have a place to sleep and don't go hungry. If you want to have fun and be a proper tourist, you will want to bring at least 20 EUR per day so that you can pay for entry fees to museums and the like.  All in all I estimate that the trip will cost you around 1000 EUR, not counting the flight. If you cannot afford to spend 1000 EUR plus the flight, maybe re-think your plans to come to Germany.  Destinations: Hamburg is cold, wet and windy. Most of Germany is cold, wet and windy in October, but Hamburg more so than other cities. My preferred locations for travelling in October are the wine-growing regions to the south. Dresden, W√ºrzburg, the Mosel area, Freiburg im Breisgau, etc. Most of these wine regions are in river valleys that are protected from strong cold winds, making them very pleasant to visit in October. Grab some wine as a souvenir and watch the leaves turn.  Basically, don't focus on Hamburg so much.  Weather-wise: Bring all the clothes you would wear in winter in Singapore. Sneakers, jeans, long-sleeved t-shirts, rain jacket. Wear tank-tops as underwear. Be prepared for rain and temperatures between freezing and 22 C with a strong wind that makes everything feel 10 degrees colder than it really is. Be prepared to buy clothes in Germany, especially a warm hoodie, warm thick socks and leggings that you might wear under your jeans, possibly also a softshell jacket or similar. Don't underestimate the effect of thick socks, thin gloves, a thin hat and a large lightweight scarf out of cotton or silk that you wrap around your neck. (If you have muslim friends, ask where they buy their hijabs.) Close the gaps in your clothes and don't let the wind chill your skin."

Some general tips:  * Be VERY(!!) cautious in and around train stations, especially in Hamburg and Frankfurt. If possible, do not go solo in these areas at evening and night. * Be aware of pickpockets * We are still a cash country. Be prepared to not be able to pay with card in some places.

Don't have all of your cash or cards in your wallet and it also helps not to walk around with the fanciest brand items. Things like a genuine Louis Vuitton bag paints a target for pickpokets on your back.   Hamburg has a big red light and party district, as a solo female traveler you want to make sure to stay away, with friends you can walk through it, but alone might give some people ideas.  Date rape drugs are also a thing, so covering your drinks, not letting them out of your sight and not telling strangers that you are a solo traveler are important too."
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 20:26:45 UTC,8,"While there is certainly some truth to it, in my opinion it's way less dramatic than you make it sound. I ride the train a lot, I've walked through train stations at night, I've waited for delayed trains (those are a real problem btw.) and the worst thing that happened to me is people begging for money.   That being said: yes, be aware, but don't be scared."
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 19:31:46 UTC,-6,"Little addition: The stereotypical Germany is what you will mostly find in Bavaria, which, quite conveniently, is also one of the safest states. You will find Munich, Nuremberg, Rothenburg ob der Tauber (tho overcrowded) and Neuschwanstein Castle there, just to name a few. Much more worth it than Hamburg imo"
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 20:02:56 UTC,2,"Hamburg is very cosmopolitan and has some great places to eat. In case you have some time left from your trip to hamburg, then consider visiting Kiel, which is only 1 hr 15 mins away by regional train. It‚Äôs a beautiful city, situated at the coast of the Baltic sea and the commute from Hamburg is super convenient and frequent."
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-15 20:17:13 UTC,2,"Heyy I'm from the UK but have lived in Hamburg for the past 3 years. It's beautiful here, and there's a tonne of cool stuff to do.  First of all, sorry about your break up! But there's really not much better to get over something traumatic than some solo travelling in my opinion :). Just make sure you try to meet people and don't wall yourself off, while also allowing yourself time alone to heal. I'll try to give some suggestions along those lines...  Sternschanze has all the nicest food and coolest bars. It's the student area, but with a big mix of ages, and it's probably the place you'll meet the most friendly, outgoing people (by German standards). One food recommendation is you've got to try Falafelstern/Kimo Falafel - two wonderful, quite iconic and very cheap kebab/falafel places next door to each other that I still consider a treat after all this time. It's not German food, so it's actually good ;) Pony Bar, near the university campus, is also nice for a coffee - Hamburg is a little light on good caf√©s in my opinion but this is certainly one of them.  If you want somewhere quiet and beautiful, I'd recommend Blankenese in the West (take the ferry some of the way, if you can! an experience in it's own right). It's a very old, very posh area, but one that is lovely to walk around with lots of nature and woodland areas. You've got to visit the 'Treppenviertel' (steps) - they're incredible and there's a really cool lighthouse at the bottom.  And obviously, the most famous thing about Hamburg is the docks, and honestly they're pretty amazing. Like, I'm usually more of a nature person, but there's something really majestic about the sheer size of the boats, and the harbour equipment. Definitely worth visiting at Sunset - the machinery across the Elbe river with the sun setting in the background looks straight out of one of the new Star Wars films - insane! Get off at Landungsbr√ºcken station and walk along the Elbe towards the (New) Elbtunnel.  One place I'd avoid exploring is the Reeperbahn, if you can. It's a tourist trap, and honestly it's just quite disgusting, overstimulating and a little dangerous. However, there are some really cool and iconic bars/clubs around there that you could go to - Indra Club 64 is one that stands out to me. It's actually the place the Beatles first performed at when they came to Hamburg pre-fame in 1960. Nowadays it's mainly stand-up comedy; the tickets are cheap and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed. I really like it there.  Hope this helps with your time here in Hamburg :) let me know if you have any questions or specific things. And good luck!"

,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-16 09:50:43 UTC,2,"Reminder that 3rd October is national holiday in Germany so a lot of things will be closed.  Hamburg is huge itself and has a lot to offer. I love visiting the HafenCity (Port City) part. They have the old ship Rickmer Rickmers as a little museum (wear flat shoes because of old ship with 2-3 masts).  For public transport in Hamburg there is a 3-day ticket for all public transports in city centre.  Also outside of Hamburg it has lovely places. For a sunny day in Stade (south outside of Hamburg) is an open museum in the fresh air about how the people lived in the area in the past like middle ages and such.  The next city is Bremen which is pretty cool too. They have there lovely coffee houses (one of first imports came from there as coffee was introduced.)  Around Hamburg and Bremen they have a lovely black tea called Ost Friese. Goes like Earl Grey but is unique to its own and nice with a bit of milk.  German's tend to do coffee &amp; cake, like the Brits but with coffee instead and only cake or something small and sweet to nibble.  If you need more tipps let me know. My Dad is from Hamburg and I live in Mainz (a bit too far away in the south of Hamburg).  Is a good idea to see through the trip and I wish you lots of luck, strength and above all to have fun while in Germany. ^-^"
,comment,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,Germany; Hamburg; Singapore,2024-09-16 10:26:29 UTC,2,"I know a lot of people tell you go to the South, but the North has some really beautiful towns and corners. *Schwerin* and *L√ºbeck* (former capital of the Hanseatic League) are worth a visit, so is the *L√ºneburger Heath* and for some quaint timberframed towns *Wernigerode* and *Quedlinburg* in the Harz Mountains are great destinations, plus you'll find more locals than foreigners there. If you swing over east to the *Wartburg* (once home to Martin Luther) near *Eisenach* then *Erfurt* (with the impressive Zitadel Peterburg), *Weimar* (home to Goethe and Schiller and near the former KL Buchenwald), *Dresden* and the *Elbe Sandstone Mountains* you'll get a glimpse of Germany that isn't tainted by Bavarian cliches, but is brimming with history.  Since you are coming from a rather warm place I hope you bring a scarf, hat and warm jacket as well as sturdy, comfortable and rain proof shoes.   Hamburg Bahnhof is not as dangerous as the other person made it out to be in fact crime has gone down significantly. But you should definitely not leave your luggage unattended and be aware of the possibilities of pickpockets, basic stuff if you're an experienced traveler."

Autumn is perfect to see it! The red bricked buildings with the autumn leaves are truly beautiful to see as you walk around the city!   If you‚Äôre there on a day not so rainy I‚Äôd recommend a boat tour! (Best the first few days you‚Äôre there I imagine) and a bus city tour to get a feel for what you want to take time to really see!! The Rathaus is great!

There were a few things that stood out to me that I‚Äôm wondering if someone can explain for me.   1. Everything is so clean! Is this just a pride thing that gets instilled into the citizens when they are kids? To not leave trash everywhere? Whatever it is, I applaud you all.   2. It seems like Germans are very self governing when it comes to following laws. I‚Äôve never seen people respect the pedestrian walk lights the way they are intended to be used. Bravo on that. Also, I saw VERY few police compared to the US. Apparently we need them everywhere to keep us in check.   3. I went to Vaduz in Liechtenstein and saw 5 year olds walking home from school by themselves. I don‚Äôt live in a city where school is walking distance from home, but I suspect that doesn‚Äôt happen very often in the US. I could be wrong, but I was shocked nonetheless.   A big reason for asking these things is because these are all things that could benefit any country. But I feel like it‚Äôs a societal thing that would take possibly generations to implement. I realize every country has its pros and cons but there was just so much I took away from the trip that made me appreciate the German culture so much, and I wish us in the United States could learn from it.   PS the main cities I visited were Rothenburg, Nuremberg, Munich, and Heidelberg. I felt so safe everywhere I went. I‚Äôm the type to be VERY intimidated by cities due to violent crime, muggings etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a sheltered person from a small town in Texas. I‚Äôve never been more comfortable in a big city like I was on this trip!"

There‚Äôs just a lot of people that think it‚Äôs reasonable to throw their trash out their car window instead of the trash when they get to where they‚Äôre going. It‚Äôs completely baffling to me and extremely frustrating! After this trip I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to start taking walks around my neighborhood to pick up trash. So at least I can do my part to help keep my neighborhood clean.
,comment,Germany; Heidelberg; Liechtenstein; Munich; Texas; United States; Vaduz,Germany; Heidelberg; Liechtenstein; Munich; Texas; United States; Vaduz,2023-03-24 07:35:28 UTC,68,There is a fine for littering out of your car. A cigarette for example is 100‚Ç¨ and up.  Leaving your trash somewhere is an environment and health violation.  Sometimes the police is in charge of these violations but mostly the Ordnungsamt. A police sub group(?) not in charge of crime investigation. More parking violations and other small stuff.

And it takes constant work to clean up.  Funny enough, one issue with some cities is not people littering, but animals.

In the US I felt like the general level if stress is higher in society. Like it takes less to snap. And I think a factor is the lack of social security. What I mean is this: if I loose my job I of course worry about loosing my standard of living (my next vacation and if I don‚Äôt find a new one kn a year or so potentially my current apartment), but I know that the state will feed me and provide decent housing. So I might ‚Äûfall‚Äú but the fall isn‚Äôt that deep. Or if I break my ankle my biggest worry is that it will hurt, wondering how well it will heal and if I can do my planned summer vacation or not. Not one second will I worry about losing my job (because they can‚Äôt fire me for this) or healthcare (because costs will be minimal). And due to this I can worry about all other things life offers but not those. And it helps a society as the crime rate is generally lower as less people need money so desperately  they feel the best option for survival is robbing someone‚Äôs house"

,comment,Germany; Heidelberg; Liechtenstein; Munich; Texas; United States; Vaduz,Germany; Heidelberg; Liechtenstein; Munich; Texas; United States; Vaduz,2023-03-24 08:57:56 UTC,71,"the comment above had very good points i want to add on to. I think also a big difference is the mindset in the US. Its a Me-and-only-me-first culture thats extremly individualistic. by that i don't mean that there aren't people that care about their community and neighbours because there are good souls out there. but more like : I have this opinion and you need to accept that, i need that xxx so you need to cater to my needs, I don't want my taxes to go into something I have no control over, I want the possibility to shop 24/7 whenever i please so there needs always be staff to provide service for me etc. Also alot of volutary work is done with egoistic motives in mind like :Oh it will look good on my college application AND i can give back to community what a great win-win situation. Which it is but you aren't quite in it by heart. In Germany we have a big voluntary community that gives back to society without expecting anything in return they simply do it because they like it. Fire department are often completly run by voluntiers, same with charity work like giving out food, organizing free kids summer camps etc.  We do alot of things in Germany that inconvinience us but are for the greater good (no shopping on sundays so staff gets 1 free familyday, paying high taxes to provide a security net even i might never need it, keeping places clean so other can enjoy it to...) I get the feeling everything that gets done in the US must benefit ME in some way to get done in the first place. Adding to that is that in the US everything is extrem in one way or another. Everything is either extremly big (Houses,Cars,mealsizes...) or tiny (nyc apartments, your 8$ drink before all the free ice is added etc.) while that are funny cultural differences that harm nobody the US is also extreme when it comes to opinions. Democrat/Republican, Pro-choice/pro-life, pro-Trump/Anti-Trump, Pro-Guns/Pro-Guncontroll the list goes on and on. there seems to be no real middleground, your either one or another and you seem to fight for one side like  your life depends on it, and i alot of cases it does bc people built their whole personalities around these opinions. Your choosen personality is your holy grail. there is not much room for discussing and challenging a opinion immediatly turns into a personal attack. that leads to alot of general aggression and the constant need to defend yourself.thats why you have a culture were sensitiv topics are barely talked about to hurt nobodys feelings abd keep the peace because discussing opinions that a ingrained in your personality will feel like a personal attack rather than a neutral discussion. In Germany we are very blunt when it comes to stuff like that which is often percieved as rudeness. But if you discuss a issue and both persons aren't attacked by whats said there is often a common middleground to be found and the conflict disolves. If one person is feeling like he is attacked and like his feeling get hurt, he gets defensiv and the conflict blowes up, no solution is found in the end. I have a feeling america has alot of microconflicts burried deep in every part of society because of this and in hard times when people are thin skined this stuff blowes up way more easy. Combining all of that with a general mistrust in others, high violance, guns, a rather extreme media that feeds of fear etc. you get a quite unstabil, unsafe feeling you can't put your finger on directly but its always there as part of your life.   In the End i like to say Germany and Europe aren't perfect in any way and the trust in society we normaly have is slowly eroding in the past years due to a varitety of circumstances, which is sad to watch. but thankfully there are still structures and mindsets in place that prevent the general feeling of fear on a daily basis i.e. kids can go to school by themselfs without the fear of kidnapping or a schoolshooting happening.   Hope this long ass post wasn't to boring to read (if anyone ever reads it to the end)"

Either you are academically qualified or you are not.  &gt;In the End i like to say Germany and Europe aren't perfect in any way  This yet another significant difference.

On the other hand its sad that we depend so heavily on voluntaries for important parts of society when they should be provided by the government. we should cheerish them more instead of taking them for granted.

But weapons are not equally distributed. I have rwad somewhere that these statistics can be translated to gun/people ratio * 0.3 is a common measure to extrapolate the gun owner count.

Coming from Germany that was a bit of culture shock. I would very naively walk everywhere. I felt uncomfortable, but could not comprehend really that this was not a good idea.  I think a lot has to do with how busy a place is. I feel more safe, when there are a lot of people around. A lot of cities in the US are based around the car. In Europe people take more public transport and are out more I feel. That makes it different for me. I may be weong"

So I was this small blond woman with a huge suitcase schlepping up the stairs and through potholes in the streets, looking totally out of place and trying not to feel endangered - and the people there were so sweet and helpful! An old black lady came up to me and said I was obviously in the wrong place, and where did I actually need to go, and then gave me directions, and a young man helped me carry my luggage back down the stairs. So yes, totally different vibe than in Germany, could have gone horribly wrong if I had met the wrong kind of people, ended up being a positive experience."

But yes, I've never been scared to walk through any major city at any time of the day or night - and I think it comes down to two major factors:  1. social security net - if people are starving, because they are getting no money at all from the state, but are unable to find or retain a job, or have mental health issues but no insurance (because that is tied to the job they don't have) - at some point they give up and resort to crime to survive.  2. gun control laws - if any nutjob can walk around armed, and any conflict/ road rage incident can end in a shootout, of course you feel less safe, and of course you need more police around. I don't think America will ever be able to change anything about their gun laws, because the NRA and the right-wing nutjobs are just too influential, but it's certainly a big contributing factor to the general feeling of unsafety and the high murder rate.  Regarding the walking children: the whole of German society and infrastructure is geared more towards walking than in the US. Our cities have pedestrian zones, all our streets have pedestrian paths (imagine my surprise in the US, when I tried to walk from my hotel to the conference venue, which would have taken less than half an hour in nice weather - and there were no footpaths next to the roads, lol), and children are taught from birth how to safely cross streets and walk home. In the small town where I grew up, they turned the whole town into a slow traffic zone, so kids can play in the streets and walk home safely from the elementary school.  But I'm glad you liked Germany - next time round, you should visit some Northern German cities, especially the Hansest√§dte, they are really worth a visit!"

But I lived in Yemen for four years in the 90s as a kid (7-10 years old) and I could ride my little bmx all over town for hours. Played soccer in the street with neighborhood kids. One time I got lost chasing one of our dogs that had escaped. So I knocked on a door and told the person living there which house I lived in (no addresses. Houses just carried relegier owners names.) So they found out the phone number. Called my parents and offered me some soda while I waited for them.

As a child, I used to spend hours on a playground without my parents being there and walked to places in our town by myself. I would guess that started gradually when I was about six years old. My impression is that unattended young children in the US are looked at with more suspicion, as in: ""Is this child ok? Where are the parents?"" Is this accurate?  I was in California with my family when I was 11. There is a specific situation I remember that could be related to this cultural difference. We were staying at a hotel in L.A. and had breakfast there. I was done, my parents were still drinking coffee, I was bored, so I asked for permission to go to our room early. They gave me the card, I left. In the elevator, an American man asked me something.

As I am informed, American towns are usually not designed for pedestrians and in many cases it might be objectively dangerous to walk somewhere, even for an adult. As children obviously can't drive, in such a place there are few alternative to accompanying them everywhere.  The situation in the countryside also differs. In Germany, cart tracks that farmers and foresters  use to access acreage are usually publicly owned. Even if privately owned, there is often way leave for the general public. This creates a park-like structure of the landscape in which children can move around on their own without the dangers of heavy traffic."
,comment,Germany; Heidelberg; Liechtenstein; Munich; Texas; United States; Vaduz,Germany; Heidelberg; Liechtenstein; Munich; Texas; United States; Vaduz,2023-03-24 05:30:22 UTC,155,"1. At least for me it was ingrained in my brain early on: littering is destroying the nature and it's selfish and bad. If you want nice places around you, you have to keep them that way. Nobody enjoys living in a dump and it's not much of an effort to not litter. I actually hate littering so much, that I will call the police one someone throwing trash out of their car.  2. The same with the traffic laws. I jaywalk sometimes but avoid it when children are nearby anywhere. For me (and many others) it's mainly about not giving a bad example to them and thereby endangering them. When it comes to driving the system is somewhat self propelling. If you don't obey the rules, you are going to have an accident sooner or later. Everyone assumes others will obey the rules. That also makes the traffic flow more efficiently. 3. In most places young children can go to school by themselves if it's not too far. The parents (or a parent) walk with them in the beginning and teach them the way and the traffic rules. Most drivers know that children are out at certain times and radio broadcasts call for caution when a new school year starts and unexperienced kids are around.  I guess what makes German cities feel save is our strong social safety net. If you ask for help and you are able to go through the according procedure you will never be homeless as a German citizen. So nobody needs to commit crimes to feed their family or to survive."

Your answer to number one makes me think there‚Äôs still something culturally different. I and many other Americans agree with all of that and do our part to protect nature and pick up after ourselves. I suspect we have a crisis of self entitlement in the US and one consequence of that is expecting others to pick up after their mess. The trip just opened my eyes to many things that we could improve. But there‚Äôs so much wrong here that it‚Äôs hard to even know where to start. Of course I‚Äôm grateful to live where I do because there are other places that have struggles beyond what I think I could handle. I‚Äôm just not too hopeful on things that require societal changes.

One reason might also be the population density. Germany is very cramped compared to the US. There is not one square inch of land that doesn't have a designated purpose. That somehow makes it easier to recognize that everything is finite and we have the obligation to manage our resources wisely but it also makes you feel stuck sometimes.

No debris/blown out 18 wheeler tires and/or general trash left on the Autobahn.   2. You'll obviously see a police presence in certain areas, such as night life spots, but in general day to day, I also see less presence which is something I immediately noticed as well. Ironically, I feel so much safer in Germany than in the United States..even at a subconscious level. I never realized it but the whole topic on guns. Its just not even something i think about anymore. I never knew it was something that stressed me subconsciously. In general, I feel Germans are more level headed and calculated when they don't find something to their liking (simple misunderstandings)...i have also yet to see a road rage incident here.   3. This one still makes me nervous...that kids will just get kidnapped. I can't help it but it's how I was raised to think as a child, always be vigilant, don't take candy from strangers, etc, etc... But it's a different way of life here. There are no school buses..schools are also generally close to the homes of kids.   As a side note to 3, there's a couple of days of the school year where police officers will meet younger kids (5 y/o's maybe?) and teach them how to properly ride their bikes to school. They'll do this for a couple hours I think for a few days, learning the rules of the road and to practice in a group. One police officer leading the way and another at the end of the line...all riding their bikes with the young children. It's honestly such a cool thing to see and puts a smile on your face. Before this training, the kids aren't allowed to ride their bikes unattended to school. (Anybody, please feel free to correct me here if I'm wrong about anything).

I figured the parents drove the kids to school.  Funny enough If a Kid was brought to school it was either   1. They slept through their Alarm and missed the bus 2. The parents workplace was nearby   We, age 6 or 7, also teased them that they werent old enough to go alone to school. So it was actually shunned to get driven to school."

There are quite some points of critique about the german police, especially it's tendency towards right-wing ideologies, but in general we are not afraid of policemen shooting us at the slightest sign of trouble, quite the contrary, the slogan of the police is ""Your friend and helper"". The main reason for the difference is probably that the german police requires several years of training, including methods of de-escalation - compared to just a few weeks (!) or months in the US. And they don't have to fear that they will be shot by basically everyone, so they only use their guns rarely. The entire german police forces kill just a handful of people each year, compared to the US were there are hundreds of police killings per year (and our population is a quarter of that of the US).  I think kids being able to walk home alone (or use public transportation) has not only to do with the lower crime rates, but with our lower car dependency. Germany is, regrettably, still a very car-dependent country, but not nearly as much as the US. Since I have joined the subreddit ""r/fuckcars"", my eyes have been opened for how much the US cities, towns and suburbs have been maliciously shaped around cars."

People walk a lot more, cause it's viable, that forms a connection to your surrounding. Littering would be basically shitting at your front door and you know what trouble it is for pedestrians if you drive like shit. Normal people on the street also make it feel safe (and also is, cause you aren't alone witrh shady people), so kids can walk alone the short distance to school (which reduces trafic around schools, also making it safer).  Germans might be a little special that they still wait at a red light at 3 in the morning, but caring for each other makes life a lot easier."

German city planners are respectful of people in public places -- they provide safe infrastructure, adequate amenities, and pleasant surroundings that invite people to stay. As a result, people respect the public places by keeping it clean.  The same applies to real easte. My home town converted one of the main streets into a highway carrying high speed traffic with tiny sidewalks. All the stores went broke, and the houses were run down, because nobody wanted to work or shop there.   So real estate prices plunged and the city started tearing down ""blighted"" buildings as an improvement. They failed to realize that the blight was the awful infrastructure they put in, and the disrespect they showed to the people who lived, worked and owned real estate there."

Main reason: people are not as self-centered (?) and watch out for each other and their surroundings in a casual way- not observing each other, but showing mutual respect. This is the scaffolding which allows us to assume we are safe and we enjoy our environment, take care of it and respect the rules we usually all agree on (they mostly make sense). And we encourage our children to do the same.

It very much applies here. In America, someone throws trash on the ground, ask them why and you'll get a smart ass or angry response that it's their right to. Civil liberties, etc etc.   Really it's the trade off between individual liberties and civic duty.   Personally, I feel the pendulum has gone much too far one way in America and the result is that civic pride pretty much is something that's largely ignored. The ties that bind Americans together are weaker than ever and the resulting polarization in discourse has exacerbated the issue.  Yeah it's safer and cleaner because generally people consider the needs of others rather than focusing on what their ""God given rights to do X"" are."

If you have some more time to spend and the weather is nice, you could visit the weissenstein mountain to have a look over the mittelland and the alps from a far.

So it's maybe not the best base to do daytrips from. The bus is often late because it doesn't have a separate lane so when there's traffic jam along the lake road (which happens frequently, especially in the evening), it's stuck in traffic jam too."

Just wanted to add something regarding train tickets. There is an offer from SBB (swiss national train service) that gets you 50% discount on all train tickets for one month, see here  https://www.sbb.ch/en/tickets-offers/tickets/guests-abroad/swiss-halffare-card.html  It's 120CHF/month (I'd assume =30 days) and is 100% worth it if you do a lot by train. Just to give you an example: a ticket from Luzern to Zurich Main station (one way) is 27CHF without and 13.50CHF with the half fare card. So if you go both ways you already save 27CHF.  You also get the same discount on boat trips (highly recommend doing a boat tour on Vierwaldst√§ttersee) or cable car tickets (e.g. up to Pilatus).   Oh and also: in other countries you can buy train tickets/travels with several different companies/sellers, but in Switzerland you get everything on sbb.ch or the SBB app, which you should definitely get if you use the train a lot.  Happy travelling! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

I would not miss Lucerne, the Gruyere region, montreux/lavaux, and ticino as the others said.  Also my region, Neuchatel, can be nice if you are under the sun otherwise. Skip Biel unless you have some affinity with watchmaking (swatch, omega, etc). The Olten one is a running joke here, don't go there. Le locle aswell, its the olten of the romandie.  If you still go around Geneva, maybe do a day in Annecy (FR).  Hope it helps. If you plan Neuchatel, PM me for accomodation tips."

Here are some cool things to see/do:  - Taubenlochschlucht - Old town on the first Friday of the every month (planty of food and small concerts/parties in the evening) - Bielersee is great for many activities:   - swimming   - kayacking (there is a nice route down the Aare and back via the canal)   - scuba diving - Bike ride around the lake. The water is very approachable. You can actually enjoy the view of the lake. 42km without the St. Peter's or 56km if you visit it. The path is ok for the city bike, too. - if it happens to be foggy, just go to Magglingen. If it is too foggy, just go to Chasseral. Both have nice nature and views on the Alps. - Visit the watch museums, or go through Rolex drivethrough  (yes, it is a thing, haha, just like buying at McDonald's) - If you like ice hockey and it is still a season, you can visit the Tissotarena - If you visit in summer, there is a Lakelive festival - Enjoy local wine. You can take a boat and more or less pick any small wine cellar you like. You can check out Twann for example  I am sure you would not be disappointed."
,comment,Austria; Bern; Geneva; Switzerland,Austria; Bern; Geneva; Switzerland,2025-02-08 08:33:47 UTC,4,"+ Biel/Bienne is the watchmaking capital of the world, you can visit the Omega museum or buy a swatch at the swatch drive through.  + The climate in Biel/Bienne is surprisingly more mediterranean than in other swiss cities (except for the ones in Ticino) which makes it a nice place to go to relax for a couple of days (assuming you go in summer).  + Biel/Bienne has an unusually high density of Bauhaus architecture and is often lumped in with Dessau and Tel Aviv as one of the must-sees of Bauhaus.   + Biel/Bienne has the oldest autonomous youth center in Switzerland, and a vibrant urban and cultural scene.   So while Biel/Bienne is not your traditional swiss tourist destination you go to if you want to see mountains, chalets and cows, it's still definitely worth a visit, especially if you have so much time on your hands."

I just don't see why anyone would go there just to visit.  I also don't get your plan anyways :) Since nobody here told you so far, I will. You have 3-4 weeks. You could technically travel multiple times from one end of Switzerland to the other. You could do it three times in one day ;)  There is also the Canton of Grisons which I really like or Valais.   Interlaken, Lauterbrunnen and Oberhofen could be visited in two to three days. Bern and Geneva are more of a single-day trip, same goes for Z√ºrich or Lucerne. Sure you can stay in those cities for a couple of days but I would rather rent a small cabin for some days, somewhere you can go hiking during the day or make other small trips.  From Z√ºrich main Station you can basically go everywhere within 3 hours. If you wan't you could visit a whole lot more places. Take an early train, be anywhere at around 9ish stroll around or go for a small hike, eat something, go some places else and you'r already back in Z√ºrich at around 7,8.  I would plan your trip in regions and stay someplace in that region and make day trips from there."

The round trip tour is beautiful if you like looking at the views and like being in cable cart and cogwheel trains. (My brothers were train enthusiasts as kids, so they loved that part.) Also the part on the ship is beautiful. But: It's very expensive. And there is nothing to do up on Mt. Pilatus. It has a quite a large tourist shop on top and a plattform to take nice pictures of the view (if it's clear). But there aren't any paths to go on a short walk/hike and it's generally really boring. If you'd like a bit more freedom in moving on top of a mountain I'd sughest going on Rigi.

I would say Zurich around the train station is more dangerous. There‚Äôs a bunch of universities that are worth walking through. In the summer they have amazing swimming spots. Lausanne is also the Olympic capital so you can visit the Olympic garden and the museum. Because of this it‚Äôs also a very sporty city.

Please tell me it's not for their tiny old town. Yea, it's kinda nice but really, really small. Nobody ever goes to Biel for their old town.  And did I read that correctly that you plan to do a 3-4 week long trip? If so, you definitely need to turn those red places into yellow places and add more red (and probably a few yellow) places too!"

13,post,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 13:11:46 UTC,1157,"Recent trip to Switzerland.. my experience and tips My plan was: 3 days zermatt 5 days interlaken and Jungfrau region 3 days Lucerne 1 day Basel   Tips 1. Take advantage of the passes Switzerland offers. It obviously saves money but more importantly gives you the flexibility to take unlimited transport in that region (assuming you take regional pass) which is super useful as you want to visit some peaks only on good weather days which you can only get to know in the morning of that day.  2. I found the below combination to be more useful that Swiss pass     - Took the half fare card (gives 50% off on most transports things)    - Took Bernese overland pass (unlimited free access to most things in interlaken/ Jungfrau region except 3 things:  Jungfrau top of Europe, Schilthon,  Brienz steam train) - took peak pass for all things included in Zermatt (super helpful to plan Matterhorn and Gornergret as per good weather days)   3. Use the SBB app to book most trains and buses and individual mountain websites to book cable cars (most of which you can just take a ticket on the ticket counter). It also has live timetables and holds all your transport tickets in 1 place as QoR codes   Super convenient.  3. Use the meteo Swiss website for accurate weather instead of other apps   4. Almost all mountain peaks in these regions have their own websites and live cams. Make good use of live cams to plan your day  5. Coop and Migros are generally present almost everywhere. They have pre made and  packed salads and sandwiches which are very convenient for breakfast and picnics. But they usually close at 7-8pm so plan accordingly   6. Although the days are long but the cable cars close by 6pm generally   So plan them in the day while you can explore the city and hikes post that.     I had one of my best time in Switzerland. What a great country and people.   Happy to help in anyway."
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 14:53:49 UTC,43,Did you use the half fare pass to buy the Berner Oberlander pass at a reduced price? That's what I did.
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 17:19:15 UTC,13,Yes absolutely!  Took the half fare and then took other passes at reduced fare.

Also got you free admission to basically every museum (the transport museum in Lucerne was the only place we didn‚Äôt get in for free, though we did get a discount) in the country. I just liked the flexibility, no need to buy tickets at the machine.   We definitely got our moneys worth, but each person‚Äôs experience will vary. We went last summer."
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 14:49:16 UTC,7,+1. Same experience here. Well worth it. The Swiss leg of our trip was easiest/smoothest in terms of travel. A pleasure compared to travel in Italy.

I bought a swiss travel pass already, and when I go to the SBB app for point to point booking, I can't link my swiss travel pass because it keeps asking for a customer number which isn't located on my receipt. Do you have advice? did you just show up with your swiss travel pass and not book anything? I am SO confused looking into all of this."

,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 14:59:15 UTC,13,"&gt; I found the below combination to be more useful that Swiss pass ... half fare card ... Bernese overland pass  Surprisingly you can use the half-fare to get a reduced (but not half off) cost Oberland Pass. For the longest Oberland pass lengths the half-fare essentially ends up being free.  &gt; Bernese overland pass (unlimited free access to most things in interlaken/ Jungfrau region except 3 things: Jungfrau top of Europe, Schilthon, Brienz steam train)  The range it covers is surprisingly large beyond that and goes well beyond that area, you can even get to Italy.  The Rothorn steam train should be included (according to the website anyway) whilst the other two just get a discount.  As a bonus saving if it is your birthday then you can go up the Schilthorn, Rothornbahn, and various other mountains for free without a pass."
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 17:57:50 UTC,2,Yes.  That‚Äôs what I did too. Used the half fare pass to purchase other passes I mentioned

,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 18:32:03 UTC,2,"So Basel (esp the train station area) didn‚Äôt give the sweet and clean Swiss touristy vibe compared to zermatt, interlaken or other regions. The city had more of a European commercial city vibe. But again it‚Äôs in Switzerland so can‚Äôt go much wrong.   I mostly visited the Basel zoo and a natural history museum and explored some river side restaurants in the evening.  The zoo was pretty nice if you are into it."

Lucerne is just over an hour away, or figure a bit over two if you want to get somewhere actually in the Alps properly."

Matterhorn glacier paradise  Ideally you would want to do the Rothorn route on non-cloudy days as well, but in case it is cloudy, you have an option to spend more time at the bottom stations in this route &amp; hopefully they have less clouds (Sunnegga, Blauherd).      Interlaken region  1. Jungfrauoch (I found Gornergret experience in Zermatt to be better than this as this is pretty crowded &amp; expensive)  2. Schilthorn route (Lauterbrunnen &gt; Murren &gt; Birg &gt; Schilthorn). If you have intermittent clouds, you can always stay in the revolving restaurant's comfort for a few hours at Schilthorn while waiting for the weather to clear up.  3. Mannlichen (this is the best place to view the Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald valleys + the 3 peak giants all in 1 spot).

They are pretty well labelled on ground and even have some form of color coding and symbols to indicate the complexity of it.  What you can do is that when going to a mountain top that has a series of cable cars, you can hike a part of it and then take some cable cars to top. Here are the ones we did  1. Sunnegga to Blauherd (went uphill by funicular and came back hiking) in zermatt  2. Similarly Furi to zermatt downhill via hike  3. Wengen to Lauterbrunnen downhill 4. Mannlichen royal hike from cable car station to the crown shaped view point 5. Hike to Rifflesee and Stelisee lakes from the closest cable car stations 6. Hike to Gornergordge from zermatt"

,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-07-05 04:59:50 UTC,2,"Hey Ankit. I‚Äôm planning a trip to Switzerland in September for around 9 days. My itinerary is 2 days Zurich, 4 days Interlaken, 3 days Lucerne. From Lucerne we will go into Italy.  I assume the best for us would be Half Fare and Bernese Oberland. Zurich we will pay for transport then with BO pass we can explore Interlaken region. Then Lucerne we may have to pay own if we don‚Äôt get the guest travel card.  My main question is that Interlaken stay is turning i out very expensive. Can we substitute that and stay in Grindelwald instead for those 4 days? The reason we wanted to stay in Interlaken area was to explore Jungfraujoch, take boat rides on the 2 lakes, check out Lauterbrunnen, Wengen etc. Does Grindelwald have enough shops and restaurants which are open during nights?

,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 20:19:04 UTC,1,We are headed to those same regions on Friday. What link did you use for the half price fairs? We are coming by train from Italy on part of a summer tour. Looking forward to it. Did you plan most things day of weather permitting?
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 06:50:43 UTC,2,Sbb.ch is where you buy the 1/2 price pass
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 14:29:19 UTC,1,"SBB.ch is the way to buy half fare pass.  Once you have this, wherever you buy other tickets such as trains or busses or other passes such as bernese overland pass, at the time of payment you can select that you already have a half fare card and the payment amount goes down accordingly."
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 17:32:40 UTC,1,Thanks! I purchased it. Unfortunately all ready bought a Bernese ticket. Curious if they will do a partial refund.
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-19 20:41:34 UTC,1,What‚Äôs the best place to have a base in?
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 06:50:22 UTC,2,Depends on where you want to go and what you want to see.
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 14:31:11 UTC,2,"Exactly. It depends.  Generally if you want to visit the places in interlaken or Jungfrau region, interlaken &amp; Wilderswil towns serve as a pretty good base for all nearby regions."

,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 14:08:03 UTC,1,Can you give details of your 5 days in interlaken region? I'm going soon and still debating whether I should get the swiss pass or not (especially that they mention on the website that u should book your seat on some trains and should pay an extra fee for that each time). So I tend to think booking each train/bus individually might come cheaper (I intend to hike and walk a lot so not really interested in cable cars)
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 14:39:19 UTC,2,"I did some rough calculations, half fare card and Bernese overland pass made the best sense. You pretty much get unlimited of all transport in that region with 3 exceptions as I mentioned in my original post. My 5 days were  1. Lauterbrunen valley and its waterfalls (take the hike from staubbach to Tr√ºmmelbach falls. It‚Äôs a straightforward hike with much less tourists). St. Beatus caves in evening   2. M√ºrren, Burg and Schilthorn.  Harder Kulm in evening.   3. Grindelwald and Jungfrauoch.  Back via Klein schedigg   4. Wengen Mannlichen and Panaromic hike (my fav. Day). Explored interlaken in the late evening.   5. Oeischensee lake + Brienz rothorn train   I apologise for the typos I made as I am typing and travelling and Swiss words are a bit complex to remember exactly."

I tell everyone about it and definitely would go back over and over. We used a Eurail pass for our trip. I want to say it was about $300 USD.
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-07-20 15:06:45 UTC,1,We used a Eurail pass for our trip for about $ 300.00.   When was that when I used Eurail pass back in 89 it was way more than that where did you get it?
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-07-20 15:09:25 UTC,1,I got it on the website. It seemed to be the most beneficial as we were crossing through a few different countries.

,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-07-20 15:20:51 UTC,2,If I remember correctly we got a 10 day pass and if you activated it when you wanted to use it and got unlimited use for 24 hours some days we didn't have to use the train. 1 of our friends on the trip didn't buy the pass and paid individually and I believe he spent $75-$100 more than us.
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-06-20 19:44:52 UTC,1,Thank you for all this info! We are planning a trip in September but will be driving in a camper van. Do you think its still worth us buying the half fare passes even though we will be driving? We will still need to buy tickets for gondolas/funiculars and maybe some local transportation into Zermatt for example.
,comment,Basel; Switzerland,Basel; Switzerland,2024-09-11 14:35:02 UTC,1,Depends how long you are staying in the Bernese oberlan region

,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-22 22:47:40 UTC,72,I lived there for four months.   I wouldn't have been able to do it without corporate funding the trip.   It was massively dope as fuck. I was nestled in a small village in the alps a train ride away from a huge airport.   Every weekend I either disappeared into the mountains or somewhere in the EU.

,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-22 22:21:08 UTC,6,"i went recently as well (May), and hiking was truly magical!      you do have to be cautious navigating the trails surrounding the city, many have a number of forks and alternative paths throughout. I got lost twice and had to backtrack to earlier points that I could recognize better on the maps. The tourism office has free physical maps available, however I'd actually recommend the [online route planner tool](https://regio.outdooractive.com/mobile/oar-zermatt-tourismus/en/tourplanner/). With this tool you can pin two points anywhere on the map around Zermatt, and it'll connect the points using the available hiking trails, giving a pretty accurate estimate of the time it'd take to hike round-trip taking into consideration elevation/distance.    Also they've got the highest mountain station in Europe there, and a short 5 minute train ride away they've got the longest suspension bridge in the world! Although I will say the hike to the suspension bridge is about 3 - 4 hours total (I'm not sure why it's so difficult to get to)."

,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-23 05:53:55 UTC,4,"As a Swiss, $20 for a pizza is not that expensive for Swiss standards."

I do suspect that one of the reasons it is rated so highly is because it‚Äôs so well developed though. You can see so many amazing things with no or minimal hiking. I feel like many other countries you‚Äôd have to be hiking to refuges or backpacking (wild camping).  I‚Äôd agree with OP that it‚Äôs largely culturally irrelevant.  I‚Äôve also always heard that they‚Äôre particularly harsh on wild camping, which is a huge negative in regards to outdoor recreation to me."

,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-22 19:31:46 UTC,7,I agree and disagree. Geneva was definitely not worth it.  We took the boat across the lake to an ancient French city called Yvoire which was much better. But I think the natural beauty of areas around interlaken was def worth it. Where can you go to see that beauty for cheaper?

,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-22 19:58:54 UTC,3,How expensive is everything in Zurich? And how did you rate Zurich?   A gig is happening in October 2024 in Zurich I am thinking about attending.
,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-23 09:19:57 UTC,3,"If you intend to come to Zh during an event, you should try to book in advance. Hotel prices are quite high anyways and during large events they 2-3x. As a cost saving option I can recommend the capsule hotel at the airport, used it once to catch an early flight. Zurich (and Singapore) is the most expensive city to live in. But it‚Äôs totally worth a visit, i love to go there from time to time. You can buy some pre-made food in supermarkets which isn‚Äôt that expensive. There is aldi, lidl with good prices too. Mcdonalds, starbucks are the most expensive here worldwide as i recall. Though you get good quality in everything, even the private label brands of the stores are good!"

What would you recommend as a budget?     I just read your post that it was not worth the hype.  Where would you recommend traveling to instead?  I'm thinking about just doing Scotland again.  How does it compare?  (Assuming you have been there.)
,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-22 23:26:14 UTC,6,"America is arguably more expensive than Switzerland nowadays. US restaurant prices + tip, hotel prices in US tourist spots and big cities etc. Ski lift passes.  It‚Äôs true."

Well, having stayed in the UK for 2 weeks, I honestly felt like I was saving money by comparison eating at restaurants 2/3 times a day and not spending as much money. Public transit was free from the prepaid Oyster Card."
,comment,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,Geneva; Lausanne; Montreux; Switzerland,2024-07-23 15:04:14 UTC,2,Skiing sucks for tourists and most people these days.  You either buy a pass and get your money‚Äôs worth or it‚Äôs a rip. Even Tier 2 resorts are pricey these days. The multi-resort passes are amazing deals at least.

Personally I don‚Äòt drive AT ALL in Switzerland, it‚Äòs just not necessary due to our public transport."

I‚Äôm confused. Did you not want to spend that money on fine dining and shopping? Or did you have a bad experience and it wasn‚Äôt worth it? That‚Äôs why your trip was so expensive?

I have a few questions: 1) did you get a rental car?   Do you recommend it? We would be doing 75% hiking activities. 2) what is a decent daily food budget? 3) how was booking accommodations? Did you need to do it far in advance?   Thanks!! Pictures look great

The other half are open every day. If you‚Äôre going to a sit-down restaurant it‚Äôs always a good idea to reserve a time beforehand just to make sure you can get in because it‚Äôs hard to know what restrictions they have.   Some shops restrict how many people can go in, so there is a line (I only saw that a few times). I was only asked once to wear my mask, and that was in a Pandora shop. Everywhere else, they told me I did not need to wear my mask, and that I could take it off.   They really don‚Äôt like things that make people ‚Äúgather‚Äù. So a lot of music is banned since that makes people congregate. (This is what a local told me, and what I have observed. I apologize if any of this is inaccurate or wrong)"

It's in many ways like Amsterdam (old buildings, a lot of canals, nice shopping and bar areas) but less crowded. Also think since there are less tourists in Utrecht the bars and restaurants are less expensive."

,comment,Amsterdam,Amsterdam,2021-08-01 03:34:25 UTC,5,"TLDR, Not anything super different or strict, just be flexible and respectful, and you‚Äôll be fine. Always bring a mask just in case. No large groups a lot of the time.   All employees wear masks wherever you go, but 9/10 times, you don‚Äôt need to wear one. Some places limit the amount of people, so there can be long lines outside. I‚Äôve rarely seen that though. Every store has different rules. I went to Lush, and they required everyone to wash their hands upon entering the store and everyone HAD to carry a shopping basket with them (they said it was because of Covid?). Not sure why. I went to a cheese store and they limited the amount of cheeses that could be sampled and said it was due to Covid.   My husband and I tried going to the gym while we were there, and they said they weren‚Äôt allowing day passes due to Covid. The only way to get in was sign a 1 year membership. We were able to find a way to get in though. It was just very complicated.   I went on a dinner cruise on the canals. We were planning on having a live piano player on the boat, but they told us we couldn‚Äôt (I‚Äôm not sure who is ‚Äúthey‚Äù, this is just what our tour guide told us). Our tour guide was able to convince them that since our dinner cruise was a ‚Äúprivate event‚Äù it isn‚Äôt encouraging people to gather, so they allowed it last minute.   We were also supposed to have a cocktail hour, but our hotel turned it into a 10 course sit-down meal, with smaller tables to discourage everyone congregating together.   I do know that there aren‚Äôt any concerts right now. I‚Äôve heard of clubs not being open or any places with music.   As far as major attractions go (Anne Frank House, Van Gogh Museum, etc.) they are all definitely open. They just don‚Äôt like to see huge parties go all at once. Our tour group had to often split up into smaller groups.   As long as you‚Äôre flexible about things, you won‚Äôt notice much of a difference."

As a quick example, when we traveled on a water bus they would sit with their legs out across the bench sideways so others could not sit next to them. Old people were standing. Every time, I would get up, give my seat away as an example, and stand like a young person would. I quickly learned two things; that no example or conversation would help this persons elitist attitude and you can be anywhere in the world and it matters who you are with.   I‚Äôve always wanted to go back one day and enjoy it with someone more like minded, more humble."

16,post,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-25 12:54:58 UTC,1826,"A spontaneous trip to Italy changed my life. I'm a 24M, I've spent the last five years entirely focused on building my career. I‚Äôve made solid progress, but along the way, I realized I was feeling lonely and unfulfilled. No meaningful relationships, no adventures, no new experiences. Just work.  Then, in a moment of clarity, I did something impulsive. I booked a trip to Italy, planned the whole thing in one night, and stopped making excuses. Time was slipping by, and while saving money and focusing on my career got me far, I wasn't going to get my 20s back. I couldn't stand the idea of not feeling alive. The world is too amazing to just hide at home.  So, I got on that flight with almost no expectations, ready to explore Rome and try solo travel. Little did I know, this trip would completely change how I see the world.  At the hostel, I quickly met some incredible people. Soon, I found myself canceling my pre-planned activities to hang out with them, and it was the best decision ever. I learned that good people can turn even a simple trip into something unforgettable. I'm so glad I approached them. I'm usually too self-conscious and wait for others to approach me, which is not the best strategy...  One of the best parts of traveling alone was the chance to reinvent myself. Nobody knew my past or my habits, which gave me the freedom to be a better version of myself. Being away from home let me finally grow into the person I wanted to be.  I saw this girl in the common room and felt drawn to her but didn't think much of it. Later, we accidentally bumped into each other while going out for a drink, and she bought me one. We spent the whole evening together and even exchanged necklaces before returning to our rooms. The next day, we had a magical date, like a scene from Before Sunrise, and parted ways as she returned to her country. That connection made the trip unforgettable and made me think about how meaningful it is to share moments with someone. It made me think about how important it is for me to find my wife and build a life with her.  I realized I'd burned out trying to be hyper-focused on success, thinking I was smarter than my peers. But we all need real experiences and connections to feel alive. This trip woke me up. I used to make excuses, like ‚Äútravel is overrated‚Äù or ""I'll enjoy it later,"" but there's no perfect moment.  Now, I'm planning a 3-6 month trip to Asia. With no major responsibilities and a flexible schedule, I have little to lose and so much to gain. I want to feel alive again, and I'm tired of playing it safe, thinking I can just save it all for ""later.""  Traveling has made me more social and opened my eyes to how big the world truly is. I can choose where to live and what kind of life to build. The perfectionist in me still wants to hold back, but that's not living. Life happens while we're busy planning for a perfect future.  I used to fear challenges and discomfort. Now, my biggest fear is living a safe, easy life in my hometown. It's crazy how one trip can change your perspective so much.  If you're thinking about going on a trip, but aren't quite sure, just go for it. This is your sign. If you can't, do everything you can to find a way to do it. Remember, on your deathbed you'll mostly regret the things you didn't do.  **TL;DR:**  After years of prioritizing my career, I took a spontaneous trip to Italy and discovered I'd been missing out on truly living. I made new friends, met someone special, and gained a fresh perspective on life. Success and money mean little if you don‚Äôt experience the world and create memories. If you‚Äôre hesitant to travel, just go for it. You won‚Äôt regret it. You‚Äôll return home a better person."

With the help of a good friend, I realized that I kept putting off recreational traveling primarily because I was very hesitant to travel alone. It was at that time that I decided to make the time in my busy volleyball schedule and just give solo traveling a try.  I planned a 2 week trip to ƒ∞stanbul for April 2023. About 5 days before my scheduled trip, my AirBnB host informed me they had COVID and I needed to find a new AirBnB ASAP, which I was able to do.  Long story short, I am now happily married to my AirBnB host and live half the year in ƒ∞stanbul!  It is funny how much life can change on a dime!  My advice ... find the time to travel and enjoy what the world has to offer.   You never know!"

,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-26 15:32:52 UTC,15,"I was just trying to convey that when you travel it opens up a new world and new possibilities in your life that you would not expect otherwise (and most of the time, for the good!).  Up to that point, I have been divorced twice. I swore that I would NEVER get married again.   When I traveled to Turkey I was not expecting that I would meet my sole mate and turn my life in a direction that I was never in a million years expecting!  We met in April 2023 and by January 2024 we were married! I live in ƒ∞stanbul most of the year until her USA visa gets approved (usually 20 months after applying).  I have never been more happier in my life than I am now."

,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-25 23:26:47 UTC,10,"Funny you say that, because I actually dated a few girls from back home purely because they loved to see what adventures I was having over the years which made them attracted to me. Girls reaching out to me, over social media, that I would have never really had a chance with if I approached them on the street.  Eventually it is also what my fiance and I connected over as well and hear we are, planning on getting married next year.  I definitely think the appeal has a peak shelf life though. Either you are young (18 - 25ish) or older (45+). Otherwise it can look as though you dont have your shit together and probably have zero wealth to your name which will not attract other folk in the 'stable / kid making / house buying period'."

I have horrible anxiety so it was a lot, there were a few days leading up to my trip that I panicked and almost cancelled the whole thing.  I was also a bit worried as a female solo travelling but that wasn‚Äôt a big deal at all, it‚Äôs turned out to be the best holiday I have ever had. I did what I wanted, when I wanted, I mixed with the locals, ate where the locals ate, stayed in the most beautiful old building full of history and I felt so at peace the whole time I was there.

,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-25 23:33:43 UTC,13,"You can pick up travellors jobs with little effort. I stayed at a few hostels I really liked and didnt want to leave so asked if I could work for board which they agreed too. Stayed in the hostels for up to 6 weeks at each one, just changing out the beds and general tidying up / washing, in exchange for a bed and breakfast. Then at nights I would run the bar crawls and get to keep tips (Americans are the only ones that tip).  I also spent 5 months in Austria as a chalet hand. While it was summer I just emailed a couple chalets asking if they needed winter workers. One got back saying yes. Free accom, food, beer, Chalet van, Season Pass &amp; a few hundred Euro a month which I didnt even need to spend.  If you go for anything less than a few months, I wouldn't even bother looking for work, just enjoy the free time. There are cheap ways to travel and still have a great time, usually this is the best way as it tests you and takes you out of your comfort zone which is ultimately more rewarding than staying in hotels and having everything served to you."
,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-26 05:13:43 UTC,2,This is illegal though correct? Working without a work visa outside your home country.  Unless you‚Äôre a Schengen citizen doing it within Schengen.  But then you‚Äôre kinda stuck within Europe and can‚Äôt travel to 9/10ths of the world unless you build up savings   And yeah I do travel and lodge for cheap but I do spend a lotta money on food and some on drink
,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-27 00:09:06 UTC,6,"Its an unethical life pro tip, but if you are working for board, its in a grey area. If you receive a cash then yes, its off the books. It is very common and no one really cares about a backpacker working for board.  You want to know another Unethical Life Pro tip? If you 'lose' your passport and apply for a new one at the embassy, it comes with no stamps, extending your Visa.  Rich people exploit poor people for personal gain, so don't ever feel bad about finding a loophole that hurts no one but can benefit you. Its a part of travelling, look at hobos for example, just out there living their best life.  Like someone else said, Holidaying is relaxing downtime, but travelling is an adventure. Rules tend to get bent when being adventurous."

I feel so bad for these impoverished communities for working in their hostels cleaning vomit and poop from toilets, dealing with drunken violent backpackers, while getting absolutely $0 for it besides waffles in the morning and a bed to sleep in. Please accept this apology.  In saying that, if you are from a rich country heading to a poor country, the majority of folk wont work a local job for $1.50 a day farming seaweed, they will be relying on their own savings.  In my experience its usually the opposite. Folks head to higher paying countries on holiday Visa's and end up working where the dollar is stronger."

,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-26 09:48:37 UTC,2,I'm from the UK. I get 25 days per year of annual leave but if I use all those days I have nothing left for the rest of the entire year. What if I need emergency days off to do things? It's a bit sketchy tbh.
,comment,Asia; Italy; Rome,Asia; Italy; Rome,2024-09-27 00:19:13 UTC,1,"Why are you gambling that you will need an emergency day off to do something? Just call in sick, you cant get fired for being sick. you also shouldn't be using your annual leave for emergencies. 25 AL days will equate to a 5 week holiday when accounting for weekends off, that's a nice little trip but is still more 'holiday' length than 'travelling'. [This article ](https://www.smh.com.au/traveller/reviews-and-advice/the-difference-between-travelling-and-taking-a-holiday-20180903-h14vie.html)does a decent job at articulating the differences.  Otherwise its simple, take unpaid leave, or quit. Not sure what field you are in but it shouldn't be too hard to find a new job within a couple of months. Folks always avoid travelling for the fear of the future. Its why people on their death beds always end up saying 'I wish I did more in my youth'.  From 19 to about 27 I would work for a few months up to 6 months, then quit and go travelling for the remainder of the year with my largest trip being 14 months.  Because I liked travelling so much and despised the concept of work, I eventually worked toward a career path that allows decent pay while only working 6 months a year in my contract, on a 2x week on 2x week off roster.   I will say, once you get a partner though, travelling is no more. Then it is just holidaying and sight seeing. You will never get the same rewards that solo travelling permits when with a partner. So before you settle down, just take the leap of faith. After a couple weeks you will completely forget your previous life and it wont even become and afterthought."

After more than 3 instances I have to have a meeting with my manager about how my sickness is affecting the job and how they can *""help""* me. I think more than 5 instances it's a disciplinary.

Or use 2 instances of sick pay for the whole year so they don't have to have the meeting.  &gt;Folks always avoid travelling for the fear of the future. Its why people on their death beds always end up saying 'I wish I did more in my youth'.  Yeah I get you. It's mostly just the safety and security. This job pays decent and nearby where I live.

A great catalog of the magnificent and often magical effects of travel!  &amp;nbsp;  One might add:    &amp;nbsp;  - Witnessing and immersing in different ways of life, different ways of seeing and being in the world.    &amp;nbsp;  - Gaining an understanding of what it means to be *enculturated* -- to belong to a people and a place, to have roots in traditions and lineage, and to be surrounded by both physical (craft, architecture, art, cuisine, etc.) and relational (etiquette, ritual, celebration, spirituality) reminders of what it means to be fully human.    &amp;nbsp;  - Connecting to humanity and nature, *beyond* political, caste, racial, or national boundaries.    &amp;nbsp;  - Breaking free of habitual self-centered thinking (""it's all about me""), and having the chance to, *or be required to*, set aside stale old habits and preferences.    &amp;nbsp;  - Learning one can depend on one's own resources; and learning how deep those resources run. You may not always pack and carry the perfect kit for ever occasion, but you can pretty much always figure something out, cleverly adapt, or bring forth enough good cheer to deal with things as they are.    &amp;nbsp;  - Discovering that failure is sometimes a marvellous outcome.    &amp;nbsp;  - The joy of living simply, efficiently."

I took 3-4 trips on an average in year from 2nd year itself. It is such a calming and revealing experience, truly shapes your perspective and makes you mature.  If one truly wants to feel the magic, go to Spiti / kashmir. They are wonderland. Spiti will humble you, specially winter spiti. Then there are beautiful treks in Uttarakhand and Himachal, which you can explore.so many good people, so much to explore. This post is a catalyst in my next endeavour to travel south East Asian countries. Need a travel buddy ig haha"

In the past our grandparents when they were young (well, depending on your age and country, etc) they were poor yes but had a lot of free time and marrying was easy. I'm not joking, lots of grandpa age people here (Italy) married by walking towards a girl and asking if she wanted to know each other to understand if they were ""marriegable."" Instead, more ""recently"" lots of our parents' age people here married the elementary school classmate or the neighbor, etc. Our generation instead? Is the one that if want to have a decent living wage has less time to spent in serach of a woman and in the same time dating became something really hard to achieve and really hard to progress.

It‚Äôs easy to get wrapped up in work and forget to really enjoy life, especially when we‚Äôre focused on success.  Deciding to travel to Italy allowed you to meet new people and gain a fresh outlook. Solo travel gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself, and it‚Äôs wonderful that you made a special connection with someone during your trip.  You‚Äôve highlighted the need for a balance between career and personal fulfillment. Life is about creating memories and having experiences, not just achieving goals.  Planning a longer trip to Asia sounds exciting! It seems like you‚Äôre ready to explore more and fully embrace life.

I could not accept the offers burocracy reasons (I had to go back really very soon, while they wanted me to change plans and stay‚Ä¶it was impossible for me).

Travel light. you don't need to carry a lot with you when doing tourist things (It's not a mountain expedition)  Don't worry if you cannot get tickets to everything you want to see; there are tons of other less popular and as worth visiting as the most popular ones.  It's OK if you do not see everything on your first time.  Start thinking about where/when you want to eat 1/2 hour before you want to eat; this will give you time to walk away from the tourist areas. (especially for lunch)  If you see a restaurant that looks nice while walking around, see if you can make reservation for the same evening or the next day  **Chill out**, sit down at a terrasse and order a couple of drinks or coffee and watch the world go by.  If you're an early morning kind of person, it's nice to go out early and see some of the sites free of most tourists; same with late night walks."

Spend at least three nights/two full days in the bigger or harder to reach spots.  DO NOT TIP unless it was life-changing service.  You cannot avoid the other tourists. You are a tourist and will be forever unless you permanently live there.  It's okay to be one of the masses and do the popular things, just be a good tourist/visitor and treat places and people with respect.  ""Ciao"" is casual and meant for friends.  You'll be marked as a tourist right away regardless, but the more formal ""salve"" is more appropriate in most cases.  You can't ""do"" Italy in 10 days. It's okay!

I am clearly a tourist but they would open the conversations that way so I think it‚Äôs acceptable."

I‚Äôve been living on a farm and everyone says ciao on the farm, to new comers, and when we‚Äôre out to eat‚Ä¶ is it actually rude to say in a restaurant setting? ü´£ If anything OP I would say ‚Äúbuon giorno‚Äù or ‚Äúbuona serra‚Äù instead of ciao.

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 20:52:44 UTC,4,"yes, it's borderline rude. Ciao is only for people you know well.   You say buongiorno, buonasera, salve, arrivederci to people you don't know.    If it is the first greeting in the morning, you say buongiorno also to your parents and siblings"

I think everyone has already said what I would say but echoing it again: -Pack light! You will need to walk/bus/train to get to your final destinations (in warm weather) and you‚Äôll be thankful you packed light during those situations.  -Don‚Äôt stress about getting to see EVERYTHING. I went into my trip trying to plan to see all that I could and the days I enjoyed the most were the ones where I got to knock out something in my list and spent the rest of the day just roaming/grabbing a drink or espresso somewhere/enjoying some gelato and finding new things I would‚Äôve never seen if I went from one sight to the next.   -If you know a few phrases in Italian, they will appreciate it but you do not need to know much. Hello/Goodbye, good day, thank you, the bill  -We did not personally get pick pocketed but were told by a few travelers along our journey who were.. it is best to just keep your bag in front of you or wear it around your body where it is harder to for someone to get their hands on/in. You don‚Äôt need to carry your passport everywhere. Some sights will say they want them but otherwise unless your making a big purchase, you don‚Äôt need to carry it around.   -when in Rome, eat in the Trastevere neighborhood! And in Florence,  across the river in what I think they call the Bellosguardo area?   -the train system is great to get around to each city or visit other nearby towns! Download Omio, if you haven‚Äôt already   -if you need a ride, taxi is the way to go but I‚Äôd suggest using an app so you know the rate. Otherwise the drivers will run the meter on you if they know your a tourist.  WeTaxi was one of the apps we used.. I am forgetting another but if I remember I‚Äôll share it!"

I recommend always using a taxi app or ride share app. we got scammed by a taxi driver when we were not patient and hopped in to a taxi outside the Vatican museum. He claimed he didn't take card and we agreed to an amount and he said he had change and got into the taxi.   At the end of the ride, we handed him 100 euros and he gave us back very little money back and told us he that he didn't have more change and didn't speak English that well.

People love their pasta when going to Italy, but personally I thought the risotto was life changing.

Stop going to places because you think you have to- the off the beaten path in Italy (which usually means off the beaten path for Brits and Americans) is often far more rewarding.  2. Don‚Äôt try to see it all. Narrow in on a few locations and spend more time to get to know them.  3. Leave time open for exploration. You will find amazing wineries, beaches, trails, historical sites, and restaurants everywhere. I have often had great experiences just randomly pulling into interesting looking places."

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 19:54:04 UTC,7,"As someone who is currently in Italy for the first time ever, and someone who did their research and touched down in Rome, now in Siena, (heading to Florence, Venice, and the Dolomites) with a fully planned 2 week itinerary ‚Äî everything takes longer than you think. And also, there‚Äôs a LOT of stairs. Bring comfy shoes!!!  FreeNow was super helpful to summon a taxi at any hour of the day. Another tip is that most streets are full of pedestrians but people make way for cars as they come. Make sure you make an FreeNow account before you arrive because it needs to verify your account via phone number. We were able to call a taxi at 5am without any issue.   Huuuuge tip is that we were pleasantly surprised by the timeliness of trains. 6am departure really does mean 6am departure!! Get to the station early. You do not need to validate Italo or Italiarail tickets purchased online. Someone on the train will check your tickets so have that ready  Belt bags are a life saver. I made mine extra secure with a zipper sized carabiner (on the zipper) attached to a regular carabiner (on my belt bag strap). Probably overkill but it makes me feel safer knowing it would take a pickpocket more time/effort to try to rob me if they have to go through that. It‚Äôs not theft proof but more like theft deterrent.   Scammers will try to put those roses into your hand. Don‚Äôt be afraid to yell at them. I had a man try to stick a rose in my bag while we were sitting on our rental bike, watching the sunset. I was polite declining the first 3 times but absolutely lost it at the guy when he tried to stick it into my bag. Do not feel bad for them and just yell!!!  The train station (SMN) in Florence ‚Äî platform 1 and 2 are not with the rest. Go up on the 5th platform and walk to the end. You should see an entrance to platforms 1/1A/2. They really don‚Äôt mark that clearly :P"

Told him ""no"" several times, but he kept trying to put the stupid flower in my bag. I knocked his arm with my forearm and he stood there stunned at me while I yelled for him to go away. It was hilarious. Well, for me at least.  Oh, and watch out for the bracelet scammer guys! They will try to put one on you and then charge you a bundle. So pushy to tourists, esp females. Don't be afraid to yell at them to go away.  Really don't buy anything from the guys who sell shit on sidewalk blankets. They're scammers with crappy goods that you would get at the dollar store, or selling fake designer stuff."

In Venice I had an outstanding meal which was very reasonably priced thanks to my hotel. They even gave us one of the few tables outside and a free drink because we were recommended by the owners friend.   In Florence last year I was staying just outside the main city and it was pouring with rain. The hotel was located in a residential area so our hotel sent us to a locals restaurant. The menu was handwritten on paper and only one person spoke a tiny bit of English. The food was incredible. We had google translate on the phone and a basic understanding of Italian.  The lady who runs the restaurant was quite an imposing figure for someone so small. Her voice was booming and I loved witnessing her talking to the locals and telling them what to pick. Thankfully she seemed happy with our choices and came to talk about the food after the meal. I just had to smile and nod because my understanding of Italian is ok but not when someone talks that fast. I don‚Äôt think she cared we didn‚Äôt understand. It was the best meal of our two week trip.

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-22 09:24:03 UTC,2,"I agree with the comment above. The best places are from locals, usually family owned, usually older people in the kitchen. Probably outiside the centre, not a vast menu option. They won't speak english very well and they probably won't be used to having tourists as clients, but that could be great for you because: 1, you get the ""italian experience"" and 2, the food is usually better with a better price as well. Even if they don't speak english, they make sure they'll communicate what's important!  I think a vague rule could be to find spots that call themselves ""Trattoria"" o ""Osteria"" instead of going to ""Ristorante"". The service is a lot more amateur but overall the vibes are friendlier... but the best thing is to befriend a local and ask them a where they eat when they go out!   Also, we LOVE when tourists try to speak a bit of italian. We get so excited - so you should try and learn at least how to order and say thank you. They'll appreciate it, trust me. Especially older people will think it's amusing and cool  I hope you have a nice experience in Italy, especially when you come to Tuscany. I'm sure you'll meet rude people (inevitable honestly) but I'd love for you to leave with some great memories!"

Restaurants - even if an hour or two before, make a reservation in advance. You‚Äôll get a better table and especially while it‚Äôs nice out - can get yourself a good outside table (not always available if you just walk up).  For attractions, buy tickets online. Even if it‚Äôs while walking there. I showed up to Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo and there was a long line to buy tickets. I just went online, paid for my tickets and walked right in.

Also if you can afford it, take Italo trains over Trenitalia where possible. It‚Äôs night and day difference.  Edit: you also don‚Äôt have to feel obliged to eat Italian food every day. Sometimes I‚Äôd have sushi instead which is really popular with locals in cities in the north, some of the best sushi I‚Äôve ever had."

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 17:42:01 UTC,2,I stay out of the big cities (I‚Äôve seen them before) and avoid the summer. July and August are hot as hell and the real Italians are at the beach. Find a small town as your base of operations and do day trips to the attractions. Much cheaper than paying for accommodations in Rome or Florence. Cars are pricey to rent but may be worth it to get around just don‚Äôt try and drive in any urban areas.
,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 18:49:08 UTC,2,"My most important suggestions are:  Don't pack places like slips in your bag. Take your time to explore and give yourself enough days for every place. Not doing the classic ""3 days in Rome, 3 in Florence, 1 in Pisa, 2 in Venice"" tour that many tourists fell into.   Try local food and don't eat pizza everywhere or pasta with truffle or seafood everywhere. Eat pizzas only in Neapolitan Pizzerias (look for ""pizza napoletana"" on Google maps). Don't eat near tourists attractions. Eat carbonara, amatriciana, gricia and cacio e pepe in Rome, Fiorentina, pasta with boar and Lampredotto in Florence, risotto, polenta and squid in Venice. Drink more aperol spritz in Venice since it is less expensive and generally better."

Obvs you're not going to get fluent (or even close) but having some go to phrases is KEY. Italians speak more english then they let on but get justifiably peeved when you come at them in english, especially when you're likely asking them for something.

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 16:17:28 UTC,2,"Know what you like. Italy has a lot to offer, so if you prefer to see medieval towns over Renaissance towns, then you should choose different cities. I personally am not a big fan of religious art (family in Italy and used to live there). I have seen enough Madonna and child paintings for a lifetime, so for me Florence is not that great. However, I loved Torino and and the museum of cinema.  Try small towns for meals. Unlike the Italian American idea of sunday sauce, Sunday is usually the day when you try to a small town and eat a long meal at a trattoria (example, the Romans go to a place in the ‚Äúcastelli‚Äù region). Also remember che la opportunit√† fa il ladro. Opportunity makes the thief, so just be smart. Closed zippers, nothing in outside pockets, keep eye on luggage when on train, etc etc."

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-22 15:14:40 UTC,1,"Disclaimer: THis is MY experience only after sever trips to Italy.  This is the ONE:  Don't expect time and schedules to work how you think they should work, especially the further south you go.  These is more:  Travel light: One backpack/carry on suitcase. You can have 18-21 outfits from just 2 pairs of pants, 2 shorts (if it's still warm), 3 t-shirts, 3 button down shirts, and a light sweater. Just do laundry as your underwear and socks run out (5-6 or each).  Wear a money belt and ignore the pickpockets.  Don't expect the local food to be what you are used to as ""Italian food"" at home. It is different and MUCH MUCH better.  Don't give money to beggars. They don't care about your 2 euros, they want to see where you keep your cash and cards so they can take it.  To avoid beggars and scammers, just ignore and walk by like they are not even there. If you have to (somewhat) loudly and firmly say ""NO!"" and keep walking.  If there are still crowds, especially in Venice, see the sites you are there to see, then walk in any direction for a few blocks AWAY from the tourists and get lost in a neighborhood that has never seen tourists. Wander Venice like this and you will avoid 'hating' it because of crowds.  Before you are hungry, follow the advice above and find a restaurant busy with locals AWAY from the famous attractions and tourists. If the sign or menu are in English, you are in the wrong restaurant.  Rome is gritty, sometimes dirty. It's old. It's been here since before Christ. That does not make it bad. It makes it historic. The sheer amount of history in this city at every turn is mind blowing. Take it in and ignore the people that might tell you how dirty it is.  EDIT: I'd try really hard to spend at least 1 day and night in a countryside town in Tuscany on the way from Venice or to Rome. Even a Full day and night in Cinque Terre would be a great addition to this itinerary. This way you see a bit of Italian Country life (which is the best kind) mixed in with the cities."
,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2025-04-24 05:26:36 UTC,1,"I know this is an old post, but the search results come up for new folks, as well as in chatgpt aggregation. So I wanted to share some insights that might be helpful.   1. Some US credit cards provide you with rental car insurance, however it is conditional on you declining the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) from the rental car company. The problem in Europe is the law does not allow you to decline the CDW thereby rendering your credit card protection useless. You'd be unprotected unless you buy their expensive coverage (min $30/day). What you can do instead is get rental car insurance from a 3rd party like Allianz which seems to have good reviews,and decline optional coverages at the rental car company. With this, you just have to pay up front and then seek a reimbursement from the insurance company. This is much cheaper.  2. If you decline their optional coverage and/or get your own, make sure to take pictures and document the damages that are already there and ask the agent to put those on file if it's not already on there. And take pictures after.  3. Gas stations: in the Tuscany region, specifically Florence, the petrol pumps only take debit cards. No credit cards and no cash. So make sure you have a debit card on you or go at a time when there are attendees. Try to get a debit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees and keep at least two different kinds (like visa, mastercard, etc.)  4. The petrol pumps near the airport only seem to have premium fuel. I saw that the base grade of fuel was always blocked off near the airport. So on your way out from the airport, just keep an eye out and maybe pull into some gas stations to just check that it's available and you can use the same station when you're returning your car.  5. In the Tuscany region there are street parking spots marked in yellow boxes (a rectangle drawn on the street to mark the spot the car should fit into) or blue boxes or no marking at all. The yellow boxes are residential, blue are paid, and no markings are generally free. But you have to make sure you can park there - if other cars are parked and you're not blocking a gate it should be ok.  6. IMPORTANT! you cannot pay for parking at the exit gate where you insert your ticket. If you do y pay at a walk up kiosk before you drive out, you'll be stuck at the exit gate with cars lined up behind you. Always pay your ticket at a machine somewhere INSIDE the parking garage /lot and not at the exit. I made this mistake but I got lucky that it was not busy, there were two lanes and I had someone with me to go pay while I waited with the car at the exit gate.  7. Reserve wine tastings and vineyard tours ahead. Reserve anything you can ahead of time and expect to be in lines at busy areas. For example, the main cathedral in Florence or the Michelangelo David statue.    8. This one is just a guidance. Everything is scammy in touristy places. Italy has a lot of scams and scam artists and pick pockets. Don't assume that everything is authentic or cultured just because it's Europe. The best experiences will generally be local spots away from the tourist squares and you can just stumble into based on the vibe. Also prices can be very expensive in store. For example, the bialetti online store was much cheaper than the physical store. And with things now being available globally for quite cheap, it's not necessary to load up things from Italy unless it's something you can't get back home for a reasonable price."

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 20:15:39 UTC,1,"Husband and I were in Rome a couple weeks ago and I noticed how well put-together most of the people were style-wise when compared to often slobby Americans. Young, old, men, women -- everyone looked great even when dressed casually. Coming from the Midwest US -- St. Louis to be exact -- it was like a fashion show just walking down the street. Even the people in the ritzier parts of the St. Louis metro looked like hicks by comparison and don't get me started on the lack of very overweight and morbidly obese people in Italy as contrasted with the States. Even with the 'rich' food offerings, the Italians were all so slim and in shape. Come to the US, especially the 'flyover' states in the middle of the country and the southern ones and you'll be shocked at the high percentage of very overweight people -- even including young people and children."

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-21 18:46:28 UTC,1,"Avoid the big cities where all the tourists congregate.  Look for smaller towns.  If you are in one of those with many tourists, look for side alleys or stairs that will take you off the tourist streets and then you can really enjoy seeing great things.  For Florence here is my suggestion, visit Fiesole overlooking Florence.  Here is [my trip report on Fiesole](https://reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/s/RACScSwPbv).  On your way to Venice I suggest Ravenna, here is [my trip report on Ravenna](https://reddit.com/r/travel/s/zT9sHWhQ3g).  Between Rome and Florence, I recommend Castiglione del Lago not far from Montepulciano and Perugia.  Here is [my trip report on Castiglione del Lago](https://reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/s/KPWpUKniyY).  For that one, click on the title, you will get the pictures and the trip report together.  When looking for restaurants, again small streets usually have real little gems, no need to have a restaurant with 50 tables, the small places with 4-5 tables are usually the best.  I usually also asked the waiters to recommend their specialties, it allowed me to taste things I would not would have picked at first and was always pleasantly surprised.  Plan ahead what you can, do your research so once in Italy you can relax and enjoy.  Do the stuff you scheduled ahead of times like museums and transfers between cities but allow also free time almost daily to either relax or do something else that piqued your attention or that was suggested by some locals.  Beware if you check travel time between two places within the same town, Google Map does not usually tell you about the elevation and many towns are built on hilltops.  Going uphill with a backpack or 2 like I did is not always easy!  When packing I used cubes for both my backpacks, I was also careful in selecting my clothes to work with just a few colors allowing for a lot of mix and match.  I also brought very light fabric clothing and 1 cardigan that I wore almost daily for 3 weeks straight as it was rainy and cold in May in Siena.  I was there to study for 3 weeks with an extra 10 days to visit other places.  Whatever I did not need I mailed back home, especially after my classes plus a few little things I had bought along the way like books and cards or clothes I did not need anymore.  I bought a book at many places I visited and wanted the info on hand once back home as I would not be able to remember everything I had heard or read while visiting.  Those books I would mail to avoid carrying them with me all the way.  Finally, just that you know, there are trains and buses in Italy, but they are often on their own schedule and do not always follow the schedule posted.  So be patient, sit back and enjoy looking at people, the scenery, have a coffee or something else to drink, do not get frustrated.  Enjoy your time in Italy!"

For example if you plan to eat in Firenze, ask on Reddit and there will be plenty Italians ready to explain you the most obscure traditional dishes.  Don't stick to pasta, and don't be afraid to try different things.  L'Antico Vinaio in Firenze makes amazing typical sandwiches (schiacciata fiorentina), kind of a tourist trap, but it's worth it. You will be amazed by the number of people waiting in line to eat a focaccia. (If you look around you'll be able plenty of little places with focaccia just as good.

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,Florence; Italy; Rome; Venice,2023-09-22 11:39:48 UTC,1,"1) Travel light, as everybody else has said... especially if you are planning on taking any other kind of train outside of the Frecciarossa. The high-speed trains do have ample room for luggage storage, but the non-high speeds do not have room for more than carry-on sized.   2) Any major supermarket is going to have premade salads in the produce refrigerators. These are typically between 2.50-4.00 euro, depending on what kind of salad you get (the more expensive ones have meat and higher-quality cheese, the cheaper ones tend to be veg-and-crouton only). They come with a pack that includes olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, a small wooden fork, and a napkin.   These make GREAT quick, cheap, and healthy lunches when you are out. The one negative is the amount of plastic, which is not fantastic. However, if you don't want a sit-down meal with coperto, don't want kebab, and would like to eat a vegetable that isn't a tomato, they are a great, easy and affordable choice. Plenty of places to sit, people watch, and eat.   Granted, of course you want to experience the food culture of Italy, but I didn't want to be dropping 10 euro min for lunch and dinner constantly. I was at a restaurant in Florence that offered a ""light lunch,"" which was basically choice of pasta or salad with a soft drink and I think it was like 13 euro. Getting a salad and a drink from a supermarket costs less than half that. Hell, you could get a salad and a bottle of wine for less than half that.  Speaking of wine, you can get a cheap wine opener at a euro shop. It will serve you well. Sunset wine looking on a ledge gazing out over the Roman Forum, or up at Michelangelo square looking over Florence, or on a rare empty canal in Venice? Yes, please. Nobody will hassle you.   3) Be prepared for water to be a bit of an issue outside of Rome. Rome does have the free fountains everywhere, but I did not see a single one in Florence. I found one in Venice that was working... rest were all shut off. I just say this because a lot of people make it sound like you are an idiot if you ever buy bottled water in Italy, but outside of Rome, Turin, and Milan I did not find free water reliably. I went to the Uffizi in Florence and after 4 hours there was absolutely dying for a drink... they were selling 500ml bottled water across from it for an eye-watering 2.80. Make sure to have your head on a swivel for grocery stores so you can pick it up for less than 1 euro if in need.   4) Do the free walking tours through GuruWalk or some other similar service. I typically tipped 10 at the end since the guides don't get paid. However, the guides are typically helpful, usually local (not always, but usually), and can give you recommendations. It's also helpful for orienting yourself to a new city--I usually tried to do a tour the first day I was in town. I also agree with not trying to see EVERYTHING... particularly in Florence, this is often impossible and insanely expensive. Go on the tour, figure out where you are and where the major attractions are, and then figure out what you want to go back and spend time/money on.   5) Skip the line tickets. Always worth it. Try GetYourGuide."

The roads can be insane, especially around Rome, but it's not that bad after you get used to it. Lmk if you'll be driving and I can give more details on what to expect.   In Florence, consider the bar in the Four Seasons just for one drink ($$$). It's the most gorgeous bar I've ever seen and, as a bonus, you can explore the hotel and grounds. It's gorgeous!

As others have said, try to go off the beaten path to eat.. not necessarily because the food at tourist places is bad‚Äîthe food anywhere in Italy is usually very good‚Äîbut because the tourist areas are extremely overpriced. You can the same meals (or even better ones) for a fraction of the cost if you try to find places further away.   - Try pizza marinara somewhere - it‚Äôs uncommon in the states but you‚Äôll be surprised that you don‚Äôt miss the cheese.  - Get a sandwich from I Fratellini in Florence.

19,post,Ferrara; Florence; Italy; Naples; Of; Rome; Russia; Siena; Vatican; Venice,Ferrara; Florence; Italy; Naples; Of; Rome; Russia; Siena; Vatican; Venice,2024-01-05 23:12:12 UTC,371,"A couple pieces of advice from an Italian Hi there, Italian from Rome here. I just stumbled upon this sub and after reading a lot of posts I feel like you want to hear one advice or two.  You want to take a tour of our country? Great choice! You will see some of the most beautiful places in the entire world. Our cities are so full of art and history that it will blow your mind. Plus, the best cuisine in the world is waiting for you (if you avoid tourist traps at all costs!).  But, in order for you to have a pleasant experience and enjoy at least the most important landmarks, you will need AT THE VERY LEAST 3 full days (= days when you do not travel by train/bus/plane) for each major city you plan to visit (usually the regional capitals like Florence, Venice, Milan, Naples). And make it 4-5 for Rome: there are so many things to see here that even six months of continuous visiting may not be enough. Smaller centers, such as Sorrento, Amalfi, Siena, Ferrara or San Gimignano, can be visited in 2 days or even on a day trip.  Plus, I understand that not everyone is into museums. Fair enough. But if you skip even the most famous ones (like the Uffizi in Florence or the Vatican Museums), you're basically missing half of the trip. How can you skip Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel or the Birth of Venus by Botticelli? And the palaces themselves which host these museums are often worth visiting, take Palazzo Pitti in Florence with its beautiful gardens as an example. Make an effort and go visit at least one of them, you will not be disappointed.  And as a side note: Italy is not a small country. Sure, it's not the US or Russia, and our high-speed train network covers all the most popular destinations, allowing you to move from one city to another in a matter of a few hours (or less). But don't overestimate it. A train trip, including transfers from a hotel to the departing station and from the arriving station to a hotel, can easily take away half a day. And if you're planning a road trip, things don't get better: Italy is 1300 km long (800 miles for our American friends), the Apennine Mountains run across it, making it more difficult to move eastwards or westwards in the Center and the South, and the main motorways are often busy. It's definitely doable and perhaps the best way to explore Italy, but you will need much more time. And that brings me to my ultimate conclusion.  If you seriously think of doing some extreme city-hopping madness like I have read many times here, something like 2 days Rome (Colosseum and Vatican are not the only things there, folks), then 1 day Venice (why, just so you can take a selfie on a gondola then head back to the hotel?), then 4 days Sorrento (???) and 1 day Lake Como (that lake isn't small, you know?), do not even bother coming. You will waste your money, you will not understand a thing, you will rush it and will likely end up so tired that you'll wish to be on your return flight as soon as possible. Just stay home and watch Italy on Street View from the comfort of your sofa.  Of course, all of this is valid if you're genuinely interested and plan on making the most out of your trip to Italy. If you're the kind of tourist who watches a Tik Tok about #LakeComo and then decides to board a plane just to take a selfie in the same spot, well, who am I to stop you?  P.S. Feel free to ask for more specific advice (even about food), especially about Rome!"

This is great advice and exactly the way I enjoy visiting Italy, especially with kids. The challenge for tourists (especially Americans) is that usually they don't have many vacation days, and to compensate, they try to cram as many cities as possible in a single trip. It really depends on your goals and time constraints. Spending 2-3 days in a city does make my trips less rushed and more enjoyable. In addition, I try to minimize travel, so I prefer to pick one area per trip to explore. For instance, last time we went to Northern Italy only. Rome and Florence might be next."

My husband and I stayed three days in the Cinque Terre. I had heard about it from a friend and did a lot of research. I knew it would be crowded. We were there during the first week of September of 2023. We were just absolutely blown away by the beauty of that coastline. Our first day was hiking and our second day we did a boat tour. I loved the boat tour, but I wish we'd spent another day hiking. I still think about those incredible vistas of the sea. Just absolutely magical. We live in the USA - the Midwest, so...  That said, we only had 11 days total. We didn't do day trips away from the cities that we stayed in because with only 2-3 full days in each, we didn't want to take time away from the cities because we knew we were only scratching the surface as it was. Our next trip, we are going to slow down even more. Hopefully we will be able to go for longer, but we are planning on a minimum of 5 nights in each place, even if that means we only stay in two places. High on our list is an agriturismo in the Emilia Romagna region and then either Umbria or Puglia. Both if it turns out we can stay longer."

I was in college and went with two friends. I think we stayed a couple of days there and we loved it!  In that note, I'm planning a very rushed trip for my parents where they have 5.25 days to see Venice, Florence, AND Rome, before heading on a chaotic cruise where they stop somewhere new each day.   Getting to the question! :) they have two days in Florence and I was shoving a ton of stuff in one day and then scheduling them a day trip to CT the next day. They aren't really into spending a lot of time in museums. They're 70 and basically want to see as much as they can because they're ""probably never coming back to this part of the world again.""  Ok, the question! Haha do you have any suggestions for two days in Florence based on that info? They're also going to Florence on a stop on their cruise, which is why I thought maybe a day trip to CT would work, and then maybe a winery trip on the cruise. Any help is much appreciated! My brain is melting over here! Grazie!"

It‚Äôs so well preserved so many cities are simply open air museums.   The other thing I love about Italy is that each city is a different era of world history basically. So it doesn‚Äôt feel repetitive.  If you take a little time to understand the significance of each (which is pretty easy to do), you‚Äôll appreciate the trip so much more."

As general advice, I'd suggest you to always check Google Maps reviews, especially by Italian users (I think you can translate them to English directly in the app). If it scores at least 4 - 4.2, it *should* be fine.  As a local, my go to choices when it comes to eat in the historic centre are [Osteria Poldo e Gianna](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Poldo+e+Gianna+Osteria/@41.9022157,12.477229,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f605168d9292d:0x7d61a494202117d3!8m2!3d41.9022157!4d12.477229!16s%2Fg%2F11cn92jvs0?entry=ttu) (best carbonara I've ever had), near the Chamber of Deputies, and [Il Gabriello](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Il+Gabriello/@41.9022157,12.477229,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f6055b92dcbcf:0x8bdfe470e4662981!8m2!3d41.9068527!4d12.4799166!16s%2Fg%2F1ttrtz76?entry=ttu), near Piazza di Spagna. Make sure to book at least 1-2 days in advance as they're always full. Note that these two are perfect archetype of how the authentic, not-tourist-trap Italian restaurant looks like: they aren't in the middle of the most crowded squares nor in front of the most famous monuments, but rather in narrower secondary streets, yet they look nice both from the outside and inside. And the only thing they display outside is the menu (plain, with clearly-written prices), not pictures of food, not annoying people trying to drag you in (the so-called *buttadentro*). I also like [Nannarella](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Osteria+Nannarella/@41.8929787,12.4814575,16.28z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f61e8881c2df3:0x219e0ff8b9b1ba94!8m2!3d41.8889194!4d12.4707297!16s%2Fg%2F11g0hv4gg8?entry=ttu) in Trastevere, [Da Bucatino](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Da+Bucatino/@41.8804399,12.4742349,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f6031ea676f2f:0xd30227262e49306f!8m2!3d41.8804399!4d12.4768098!16s%2Fg%2F1v3z_y8z?entry=ttu) in Testaccio and [Colline Emiliane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colline+Emiliane/@41.9056081,12.4646823,15.23z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f61ab842d1761:0xf2781bf66cdf53f8!8m2!3d41.9029515!4d12.4873707!16s%2Fg%2F1tkjnmvx?entry=ttu) near Piazza Barberini. The latter is an Emilian restaurant (from Emilia-Romagna region), not a Roman one, but I recommend it anyway because the Emilian cuisine is home to some of the most famous Italian specialties, like lasagne, rag√π alla bolognese or tortellini (and also because my family is from there hehe).  For aperitivo I suggest [Terrazza Esselunga](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Terrazza+Esselunga/@41.9046978,12.4749079,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f6160c863d84b:0x14481c612d348053!8m2!3d41.9046978!4d12.4774828!16s%2Fg%2F11jz5nclfs?entry=ttu) or the [Rinascente rooftop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/MAIO+Restaurant+%26+Rooftop+Roma/@41.9029517,12.4820183,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x132f6058dcf5cd1b:0x29737a9f1d22e1c3!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f61ab333d3cd7:0x5dab8a54fa5f18c9!8m2!3d41.9029517!4d12.4845932!16s%2Fg%2F11kp_qbq56?entry=ttu). The first one has the best value for money, the second one has excellent food and an amazing view of Rome, I had my graduation party there some months ago and it was all excellent.  For pizza, honestly I haven't been to many pizzerie in the historic centre. I've heard good things about [Piccolo Buco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piccolo+Buco+(NO+PRENOTAZIONI-NO+RESERVATIONS)/@41.9003531,12.4632436,14z/data=!3m1!5s0x132f61accf39d203:0x37b6243ab6313ecb!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f61acc58661e3:0x8217414b32eca6fc!8m2!3d41.9012999!4d12.4846381!16s%2Fg%2F11g_86_13?entry=ttu) (neapolitan pizza, it doesn't accept reservations) and I had a very good pizza at [Tacito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q8jpTD8ra1tKN6Gd8) in Prati."

I have been four times to Italy because it is the place of my heart. It has always been my preference to spend numerous days in any one city, in part because Italy to me is about neighborhoods.   A little story: last September my friend and I spent several days in Napoli. One evening we went out for happy hour. Beside us were a number of long tables set up together, as if there would be a huge party. People over there were talking, laughing. They did not sit down for at least an hour, and then it was clear that this was a big family enjoying one another.  I love the fact that they were not rushed, no one hurried them to order, they all were just so happy to see one another. I asked if I could take their photo because I was so moved (and because ""Per favor, posse fare un foto?"" is about the only sentence I know) and they said yes.  Edit: UNA foto! Lol  THESE are the memories I savor from Italy. Well, and ""The Rape of Proserpina."" And the way people fuss over babies. And..."

I don‚Äôt personally feel compelled to fully commit to uncovering EVERY rock while I am in a city. While Rome is great and I am sure you could stay busy for 5 days there easily, I don‚Äôt necessarily want to spend that amount of time sight seeing in the same city (on a sight seeing type trip at least).  I found that taking a couple days away from Rome and Florence and adding in smaller towns / cities around was much more pleasurable and gave a more diverse view of Italy.   Now there is a happy medium‚Ä¶I am not saying you should just rush around Rome for a day and snap your photos and get out. But there is a lot more to Italy than the major sightseeing points in the major cities. If you only have 8-10 days in Italy, I wouldn‚Äôt spend the majority of them in Rome / Florence.  Although I completely agree on the size / travel part of it. I know people that travel to 3 different countries over a week long trip and I don‚Äôt get it. Pick a region and stick generally in that area (Tuscany, Amalfi Coast, Alps, etc)"

Like, when someone says ""I'm landing in Rome, then I have a hotel booked for Venice, then I'm going to go to Naples, and then to Florence."" What?! Why?!  But everyone's priorities are going to be different, and some people -- especially Americans with limited vacation time or anyone without a lot of disposable income -- are going to need to plan their ""Italy trip"" like it's a one time deal. If you only have a week but your bucket list items are to see the Colosseum, Sistine Chapel, Uffizi Gallery, and take a gondola ride in Venice... you ""need"" to get to all those places in the week, even if it means only having 2 full days for Rome and a full day each for Florence and Venice.   We need to be willing to work with people to help them streamline what time they *do* have to see the things they've told us they want to see -- not judge them for taking a vacation we don't find ideal.  It isn't intentional, but it absolutely comes from a place of unrecognized privilege, to suggest everyone ""needs"" to spend X amount of time in this place, or it isn't worth their time. It fails to count in factors of how accessible that destination is to the individual tourist, how much time they realistically have to visit Italy over the course of their lives, and what their individual priorities are.  I think most of us are on the same page in the sense of... if you have a month just in Rome, knowing you can *also* later spent two weeks in Florence, and then take another trip to spend a week in Venice, etc... that's a much better ""way"" of experiencing those cities than hitting all three in a limited time. It's just totally divorced from the realities of many travelers."

It all depends on what your ideal holiday looks like. You can absolutely spend, say, 2 full days in Florence then do a day trip to Siena and another day trip to San Gimignano, if you'd like to see more diversity and take a look at smaller, less crowded towns. But you'll inevitably miss something. And if you repeat the same pattern for other destinations in the same trip (for example, in Venice and Rome), chances are you'll be absolutely tired in less than a week. You can do this, but you'll need *more time*. A more balanced itinerary would look like this: 4 days Rome, day trip to Castel Gandolfo, 3 days Florence, day trip to Siena, 3 days Venice, day trip to Verona."

If you spend more time in Florence you miss Siena. If you cut Florence shorter to make time for Siena, then you are inevitably missing something in Florence.  That is just something you have to accept traveling‚Ä¶ that you aren‚Äôt going to do/see everything there is to do/see. And frankly you probably wouldn‚Äôt want to.  I am also not sure why spending a day in Siena rather than an extra day in Florence would be more tiring either. In fact some of the most relaxing days were in smaller towns like Cortona, Arezzo, Montalcino, San Gimignano, etc. Just my two cents.  Another part of it for me is that, yeah theres a million things to do in Rome and Florence but at the end of the day a lot of them are KIND OF the same thing. The history and architecture and art etc is all great but at the end of the day, idk that you get much out of a 5th day of looking at old marble columns and statues.   Again, its all great, I don‚Äôt mean to demean it, but there are a lot of other more diverse itineraries."

Going from the hotel to the train station to the smaller city can take up to 1-2 hours. Add the return trip and you've lost something like 3-4 hours which could have been spent visiting an important museum/monument in the big city or just exploring another part of the historic centre (unless you wake up very early in the morning, which you can do but that can become stressful in a holiday, especially if you've walked a lot and repeat this pattern multiple times during the same holiday). Again, I'm not saying you can't do that. But if you do cut even the minimum amount ot days needed to see the biggest centres, then it's not ideal and you're rushing it, and if you don't, you need to add more days (which I recommend, if possible)*.* A big part of every holiday in Italy is wandering around the city and just feel the atmosphere, which is unique to every city (or even district, take Trastevere in Rome or Quartieri spagnoli in Naples for example).  Also I strongly disagree that most things to do in Rome are ""kind of the same thing"". Rome has a history of 2500+ years, there are buildings and monuments from all time periods and the historical/architectural diversity is out of question, since it spans from the Roman Forum to the 1940s-50s rationalist EUR district. There is *always* something new to see here, even for locals. What you say may be true for smaller cities, but certainly not for Rome, and that's something that every single Italian will tell you."

We rented a car on our last day in Florence and spent nights in Cortona, Montepulciano, and Siena.   From those towns with a car, visiting a neighboring town is easy and we rarely spent more than an hour commuting each day. It was actually a lot more relaxing than being glued to the city.  It can also be fun to travel if you mix it up, we rented bikes and rode on gravel roads to Montichiello. Another day we rode Vespas around Val d‚ÄôOrcia and up to Castiglione d‚ÄôOrcia.  Obviously Rome has a very rich history that spans a wide variety of timelines. But you can certainly fill up on ‚Äúlook at this important piece of art / architecture‚Äù is all I am saying. We certainly welcomed the change of scenery in Tuscany after our time in Rome / Florence."

Those who love cities and want to relax on their trip - yes, your advice is perfect. But you forget that there are different types of traveling. For example, road trips heavily rely on the idea that time driving is the main goal. So then the goal is not to see everything that, for example, Milan has to offer,  but to hopp off the car, climb up on the roof of Duomo, visit Da Vinci museum, visit the castle, get a few hours of sleep, hopp back in the car and drive further enjoying beautiful country roads, small villages and scenery in general. We traveled both ways, and I enjoy that kind of road trips way more. Yes, I come home absolutely exhausted, but I account for that, scheduling a few days after the trip just to relax and unwind. Both kinds of traveling are good and valid, and different people enjoy different things. I don't mind coming to the same city a couple of times and spending only a day in there, but I do not enjoy spending several days in the same city continually. The only exception is Rome, I would definitely spend more than a day there at once. Sorry for my broken English. I hope you understood my point.  P.S.: I have been traveling my whole life and have seen many countries, but Italy is unmatched. You truly live in the most beautiful country, a heaven on Earth."

For the accommodation, I suggest 4-star hotels from chains like NH, H10, Best Western.  For the itinerary, I would like to add to the list below the Quirinale Palace, the seat of the President of the Republic. Sadly it's not so popular among tourists but it's definitely worth visiting, if you can find a ticket on the [official website](https://palazzo.quirinale.it/visitapalazzo/prenota_en.html). It's one of the biggest head of state residences in the world, with wonderful gardens and amazing interiors. The hill where it stands has been inhabited since ancient Roman times (there are remains of a Roman domus underground!) and it's been the seat of power for centuries, from the Popes to Emperors to the Kings of Italy to the Presidents of the Republic. Check it out!"

We went last week of September through October 10th. Will definitely be returning hopefully on 2025.  We flew into Milan, rented a car and stayed across the street from S. Maria delle Grazie and saw Davinci's Last Super and his ""vineyard' across the street where he stayed while painting The Last Supper which is now closed unfortunately.  Stayed up all day and enjoyed food and area of Milan.  Next morning drove to La Spezia and spent the day hiking and eating and relaxing in Cinque Terra. Had an amazing dinner on La Spezia and spent the night.  Next day drove to Bologna but made sure to stop at Modena. Visited Enzo Ferrari museum and had an amazing lunch at a cafe. Was introduced to a sparkling Lambrusco which became an afternoon drink of choice during the trip. The exploring by car was wonderful!  Stayed 2 nights in Bologna enjoying the food and history.  Drove to Florence and dropped the car off. Spent 2 nights in Florence, stayed at an amazing palace 2 blocks from Duomo and 1 block from David. Beautiful city and fun place.  Took the high speed train to Rome and spent 5 days there. Cut Venice out of the trip to be in Rome longer. Perfect amount of time 4 days on Rome. Walked mostly everywhere and saw the sights we wanted, Vatican, Palatine Hill, Colosseum, Pantheon, catacombs. Spent evenings at the very end of the night in a local bar with local band of 2 guitar players singing Italian songs, drinking and dancing. Did that 3 nights, Molte Bene!  Rented a car from Rome termini and drove to a planned winery in Montepulchiano. Had an amazing time eating and drinking and met some new friends. Spent the evening with a couple that was a pilot and flight attendant for Al Italia at a little place in Montepulchiano. So much fun  Spent 2 nights in Siena, for another winery tour and drove back to Florence to drop off the car and train to Milan.  Spent day and night there, saw the Duomo and took the train to the airport.  Best 2 weeks vacation. Favorite places were Sienna, Cinque Terra and Montepulchiano. Rome was awesome also just a different flavor.   Looking forward to it next trip back to the motherland!  Mike"

My wife and I have been coming back to your wonderful country for years.  Overall, probably at least 6 month.  The shortest stay has been 31 days but usually 2 months at a time.  I have spent over 13 nights in Rome, it is a magnificent city, I stay in Trastevere, but I have not seen it all.  I have spent 11 nights in Florence and the art and history is amazing.  This last trip, I spent 4 nights in Orvieto and I wish I had time to be there longer, I have stayed 5 weeks in Montepulciano and I have enjoyed every moment.  Quick tourists never taste fresh Ricotta, still warm after making Parmigiano Reggiano.  They miss the piazza in Mantua, the annual return of the chefs at the cooking school in Villa Santa Maria.  I spend about an hour every day trying to improve my Italian language skills because I believe that speaking your language when I am there, I somehow show the respect I feel for your country and your culture.

Many tourists spend 1 day per village and pair it with Tuscany, as landing in Florence (or in Rome, then take the train to Florence) then going to Pisa and taking the train to Cinque Terre from there is the easiest access.  Many people do day trips to Cinque Terre, but it is said the most magical time is the evening, where you can see the place much emptier than in the day and truly enjoy it. I'm sure it makes sense to spend even 2 days in each town if you like to spend a day at the seaside or do something special on top of the place's walking tour.  A friend's mom with a passion for walking joins a trek that takes you from Pisa through all Cinque Terre by walking every year around Easter time."

Best post I could have read right now. Full time working Americani here, trying to squeeze in travel whenever possible! Traveling to March for 1 week to Rome during spring break with the kids- and only doing Rome- 8 days/7 nights with a vrbo in Prati. I kept second guessing myself because everyone else crams multiple cities into all of their trips- but I feel that then you cannot truly appreciate the country, the sights, the people. I keep saying that these are just the first trips of many and we can always go back to see everything else. I view travel as a long term love affair, not a one night stand.

One week will allow you to fully enjoy the Capital and see all the major monuments/museums and even some more.  There are three metro lines in Rome, but only A and B are useful for tourists. Note that the Metro, unlike other European capitals, only covers a limited portion of the historic centre, and you can reach the areas closer to the bend of the river Tevere (the rioni west of Piazza Navona and Trastevere) only on foot or by bus/tram. In most cases, a good walk through the city centre will allow you to properly experience the beauty of Rome and therefore will be better, unless you have to reach a far destination or you don't have much time (in your case, for instance, it makes sense to go from Prati to the Roman Forum by metro). Sometimes there are public transport strikes (usually near the weekend), so be sure to check [Atac](https://www.atac.roma.it/en/home) website for updates."

The thing is that, in my personal experience, the american way of ""visiting"" a city is, to a certain degree, approximative.  Don't want to generalise or offend, and know there are always different people, but I have seen lot of people ""visiting"" Capri by seeing its piazzetta, get an ice-cream and then go away. Or ""visit"" Milano by seeing the Duomo, taking a couple of pics and then go away to the next city or place. I believe there is an underlying cultural difference about travellinf that needs to be somehow taken into consideration.

Here's what I answered some comments ago:  I suggest to avoid the area around Termini train station, especially via Giolitti and Castro Pretorio, because by night it becomes dangerous. I'd also avoid San Lorenzo (meeting point of universitary students by night, many bars and night clubs, but very noisy and sometimes dangerous) and the periphery east of the railway ring. The rest of the city centre is fine. In Prati there are many nice hotels, also in via Veneto and its surroundings (but they're more expensive)"

I'm visiting Italy for a wedding in early September in Siena. Before the wedding, we'll be in Milan for a weekend.  Any recommendations for an itinerary from Milan to Siena for Monday-Friday? Should I rent a car or go by train? I really don't want to do the ""speed tourism"" so I want to prioritize/skip and be realistic with what I can do in 5 days and do it right!   I'm thinking Genoa, La Spezia and Pisa. Are any of these places worth just stopping through for the day?

I do have a question. The plane arrives in Rome on Saturday at 15:30, I'm going to Naples, Palermo and Catania so I was thinking of taking the train directly to Naples the same day.  However I think that way I'm going to waste a Saturday night travelling when I could stay in Rome that night and do something, go out for dinner, to a concert, an event or something. I have already visited Rome several times so I already know all the touristy things. What would you recommend for a woman travelling alone to do on a Saturday night in Rome (in may), something really meaningful and local, but not forgetting the safety issue, and also nothing fancy.  And I'm off to Naples early in the morning....."

I've been to Italy many times and honestly dislike museums to the point of almost totally avoiding them (but have been to Uffizi and the Vatican) but still think you need 3 days in a city, for sure. One of the best things about Italy is the lifestyle and the way people live. The cities have a rhythm that you can't catch in just one day.   I'm curious where you recommend visitors to stay in Rome. I've stayed at Villa San Pio on the Aventine going back almost 20 years, but lately have found it to be far less charming and pleasant. I've have been looking for other places in other areas, both for myself and to recommend. I recently stayed in Esquilino and found it very nice. Do you have recommendations that you give tourists?"

I'd also avoid San Lorenzo (meeting point of universitary students by night, many bars and night clubs, but very noisy and sometimes dangerous) and the periphery east of the railway ring. The rest of the city centre is fine. In Prati there are many nice hotels, also in via Veneto and its surroundings (but they're more expensive)"

The wife and I planning a vacation 1st week of September. We want to spend 3 days in Rome the hop the train to Naples. After 2 days in Naples we want to take the ferry to Capri for 2 days before returning to Rome. The wife is all about sightseeing and I'm more into relaxing on the beach. Any suggestions???

Since you'd like some relaxing time on the beach, I suggest a compromise: 4 days Rome (or Naples, if you have already visited Rome) sightseeing and 3 Capri on the beach. Your first plan is a bit rushed and in my opinion only doable if you add one day for your arrival flight and one for your departure. Also it's going to be hot. Very hot."

However every region, especially in Northern Italy, has its kind of filled pasta (Piedmont for example has agnolotti) and you should be able to find it nearly everywhere (ravioli ricotta e spinaci are fairly common across the country).

My wife and I are planning a visit in summer 2025. Current plan is to do Rome + a coastal city as we want to spend some time on the Italian coast. Currently our plan is to do Rome 3-4 days and then a coastal city (Naples, Sorrento, or Palermo) for 2-3. We're very open to any coastal city however as we are considering somewhere in Sardinia as well. It may come down to how easy it will be to travel there from Rome. Based on your post and some of the comments, a two-city 7 day trip seems reasonable."

Then, on day five, take the train to Venice.  We will stay in Venice and then fly out of whatever airport is closest to Venice.  Based on your advice, perhaps we should skip Venice and add on time to Rome and Florence.  Is that what you would recommend?  We are from the USA and have never even been to Europe.  Thank you"

Some of it depends on how you like to travel. I‚Äôve been to Rome several times. As OP said, there‚Äôs always more to discover. If you like art, there‚Äôs a ton including some good contemporary exhibits.

I've frequently advised friends who are traveling to places I've visited-and-or-lived, to pare down their itineraries to visit less places and do more depth.  The problem is, there are a lot of places in the world, and you can't spend enough time really getting to know even a minute fraction of them.     While long stays in many places have been wonderful, I also have some amazing memories from some short ones.  The first time I visited Rome was due to train schedules traveling back from Greece (pre budget airline days).  I had met some Canadians traveling the same route and we arrived around 8 in the morning and had separate trains departing in early evening.  We had no itinerary or even a guide book, we just wandered the city and came across things.  Amazingly, we saw the Sistine Chapel (free day, and the line wasn't long at all), Spanish Steps, Trevi fountain and a number of other landmarks.  It was amazing and easy and well worth it."

20,post,Florence; Italy; Rome,Florence; Italy; Rome,2024-12-25 21:16:13 UTC,352,"Reflections from an Italy trip - and tips for travelers Just spent 10 days in Italy. 3 in Milan, 4 in Florence, 3 in Rome. Flew into Milan, out of Rome, both direct. Note this was my first time doing a trip like this.  * All 3 cities are absolutely beautiful. Architecture like I have never seen, art, history, culture. I think Milan gets slightly too much hate and is worth a visit. The Milan Cathedral is jaw dropping. Never seen anything like it and never will again. It's definitely more of a shopping city, but it has all the beauty and history and food you could want in Italy. And the shopping really is great. Very walkable * Florence - like many others here - was my favorite. It's like time is frozen here. So walkable, so much history and culture, so much to see * Rome was most similar to a big metropolitan city. The Colosseum and Roman Forum are must-see. I used a guided tour and it was very organized and very worthwhile. Learned a ton. * All 3 cities are VERY user-friendly and easy to navigate through. All have reliable Uber. All have enough English signage and support so that I felt comfortable as a non-Italian speaker * Trains between each city were very easy. Just pay attention to the board and you'll be fine. All train stations in good locations as well. * My favorite days were spent without a plan, just walking the cities. I had a bit of a plan of what I wanted to see before the trip, but it was so easy to just walk around and do whatever catches my eye. This is, of course, coming from the ""off-season"" of tourism so maybe it is different. * Don't eat directly on Duomo/next to tourist attraction. Food 2 blocks away will be twice as good for half the price * Everybody was friendly. They know that tourism is a huge, important piece of their economy. * I personally did NOT see any pickpocketing, but I was always aware of surroundings. Just walk away and keep distance from suspicious looking situations. * The leather in Florence is legit beautiful * They start dinner later, around 8PM, and everyone takes their time * The weather was nice for walking (and you will do a ton of walking). Mid 50s and got slightly warmer from Milan to Florence to Rome.     Overall a complete 11/10 trip and I cannot wait to go back. A great user-friendly experience as well. Grazie!"

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome,Florence; Italy; Rome,2024-12-28 08:00:20 UTC,2,"If you do the Vatican, the skip the line tours are worth the money. Go first thing in the day and not on a Weds.  Suggest the capuchin crypts but was underwhelmed by the San Callisto ones. Go to the Domatilla Catacombs if you can but make sure you pay attention to the day of the week bc each catacomb is only open certain days--actually.good advice for the whole trip is paying attention to what days you do which. I missed out on a lot since I booked over Xmas Eve and Xmas. If you want to see more beautiful places, the 4 Papal Basilicas (esp St Mary Major) are recommended just be mindful of mass times and being a Jubilee year. Also recommend The Roman Food Tour walking tour. I did the Prati one since that was the neighborhood where I stayed and it gives you a good lay of the land plus several good food choices you might not discover. If you or anyone with you is gluten free, recommend Mama Eat (Prati) or Old Bear (city center) for food. Also recommend Il Segreto or Passpartout (Prati) for dining."

There is a museum near the forum on the capitolium. Museo capitolini as well. Of course if you don‚Äôt wanna do only museums just take walks by the river and Trastevere. That‚Äôs the medieval Rome.

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome,Florence; Italy; Rome,2024-12-26 20:47:43 UTC,0,"Totally disagree. While i am also sick of the mass tourism in general, also tourism is good for the country and economy. As italian living in rome myself and i still enjoy the city despite tourism. I see much bigger problems with domestic tourism. Anywhere i go in the summer on the beach italians aren‚Äôt respecting our own country. Foreigners pick up their garbage and throw it in the trash or take it back to their place. Italians throw everything on the beach. Littering the roads and nature wherever i go and it makes me really upset. I went to a beautiful beach this august and i see families drinking and throwing plastic bottles and cups into the sea. The shore in the sand. Anywhere but garbage. If i question they arrogantly send me away that it‚Äôs dirty already why do you care. We have much bigger problems than foreign tourists who at least know how to behave in our country (most times. I also despise the instagram queens taking selfies everywhere)."

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome,Florence; Italy; Rome,2024-12-26 22:49:17 UTC,2,I didn‚Äôt talk about rome. I talked about beaches in general. Liguria. Puglia. Sardegna. Or pick the ones you like. (Btw. Rome has more Americans than any other city in italy) But I have been to Como. Many times. Been to lake garda 20+ times. I didn‚Äôt see much problem their with the foreign tourism and tourists in general. I regularly go to Sardegna. Locals always complained about americans. ‚ÄúToo many tourists‚Äù blabla. Then when the tourists disappeared and it became quiet again most shops went bankrupt (not the tourist ones. Local shops because locals didnt have any money to spend). Then they complained about no tourists. ‚ÄúWe wish the Americans would come back and spend the money here again..‚Äù  i know lombardy and milano‚Äôs tourism to gdp is probably 1% and you don‚Äôt care. But Italians are the only ones always complaining about the ‚Äútourists‚Äù. I see many tourists in Austria in the mountains. Or in Vienna or Salzburg and I never hear the complaints. (I lived in Austria). People are happy and take pride that others admire their country. We‚Äôre the ones always ‚Äúhating on why do they come here‚Äù. Be proud that Italy is admired by the world. Try to protect it and maintain it as much as possible. Much better than the complaining.

,comment,Florence; Italy; Rome,Florence; Italy; Rome,2024-12-27 16:47:26 UTC,1,I would (and plan to) go back to Milan just to see the Cathedral again. I simply cannot fathom the idea that people started construction in the 1300‚Äôs! The level of detail is unmatched. Each window is its own piece of artwork. The giant doors and the woodwork is just insane. Probably the greatest man-made structure I‚Äôve ever seen in my life.

I usually go back to countries that I visit, but this is the first time I genuinely don't want to come back.   The only redeeming factor was Florence. Milan was alright. The food was great value, but the best in taste? Absolutely not. I was underwhelmed. But the gelato were amazing.  Bus/Train schedules were unreliable, horrendous and non-existent in rome. Even Canada is better in this regard  What really ruined the experience is the cold/mean people here (I am not Italian). Inb4 angry Italian local be defending and downvoting (ü§Æ)"

Enjoyed Florence so much we got a 2 bedroom place in Florence for April earlier this year. Was able to day trip Venice, Cinque Terre, San Giamano. Going back to Florence again this April for another month.   Great place to just chill, walk around the city or to travel a couple hrs by train to explore."

Train to Rome in the evening   8/2: Saw the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, and Piazza Navona. Checked out the Vittorio Emmanuelle monument in the evening   8/3: Guided tours of the Colosseum + Roman Forum, and the Vatican   8/4: Train to Naples in the morning. Underground tunnel tour, saw Piazza Plebescito and waterfront   8/5: Day trip to Salerno booking a Lido. Stopped by Amalfi on the way back   8/6: Flight back  Here's the rough overall cost for our trip   Flights: $4000   Hotels: $1750   Food: $1000   Tours/Attractions: $1500   Transportation: $500  Total: about $9000  Ok, so here's my thoughts on the overall trip  Yes, we did go during peak season. However, I honestly don't think it was that bad. The heat was pretty tough on a few days, but if you're in the city - typically you'll have a ton of shade because the buildings are high and the streets narrow. What we would do to avoid the worst of it was to take a break between around 2 and 6 PM most days and return to our hotel during that time. This allowed us to avoid both the crowds and the heat. Obviously, there were some days where this wasn't possible, but for the most part I don't feel like our trip was overrun with tourists.       Booking in advance is massive. We did this whenever possible, and it really saved us a lot of time.    If you have the additional money, I would highly recommend tours for a lot of the bigger attractions - as you learn so much more about the place itself. The tours for the Colosseum and Vatican were incredibly informative. Plus, in some cases, being in a tour meant you get to skip the line or take a shortcut.       My family is vegetarian, so the food did get a little bit limiting at times. Most restaurants will have at least a few vegetarian options, but after a while the constant diet of either pizza or one of a few select pastas gets a bit old after a while. I did really enjoy the vast majority of the food, however, I think I'm going to need a couple months break from any kind of pasta or pizza. I'm pretty happy I got to try out some famous places though, like All'Antico Vinaio, Osteria da Fortunada, Gino e Toto Sorbillo, and even a two Michelin-starred restaurant.   The trains are a super convenient way to get around. Both the Florence-Rome and Rome-Naples train took under 1.5 hours, and were super comfortable.  The majority of people I interacted with spoke at least basic English, and pretty much everybody understood it. This made interacting with people super easy.   Pretty much didn't experience or notice any crime at all.  If anyone has any other questions/comments, feel free to let me know. Happy to be of any help!"

But did you actually  SEE  anything?  That sounds like you ran a marathon to all the tourist spots.  Two days in Rome? 1 day in Naples? Salerno and Amalfi in a single day? It sounds exhausting.  And that's a lot of money to spend to barely see and enjoy Italy.   That's like Italians I know here,  who plan trips to the states and say thingxs like.-.....I want to see Washington DC,.   New York City,   Niagara Falls,  Las Vegas and the Grand canyon..........in a week.   Is it doable?    Ohhhhhh, sure......it's  doable I suppose......... if you're insane and rich enough."

My wife's from Chicago, I'm Italian, and this has been a huge conversation topic with her family when she decided to move here 20 years ago: the value of personal time over money. We have average jobs, average money, and average time off, meaning we work 30-32 hours a week and have a little more than 6 weeks of vacation that we spend going around the world (mostly off season). And if you think that Italy is the western european country with the worst personal time ratio, you can see the striking difference between here and there. We could have done the same jobs in the US, earning 8 to 10 times as much, but barely having a life as we want.

Genuinely curious, it's not meant to be a harsh comment btw, since tone often comes across as twisted on Reddit. I always thought the basic working times in Italy for employees were 40 hours a week, and more if you're a waiter or a clerk. Agree on the general difference in perception regarding the holidays. My partner lived in the US for a few years and was telling me how hard it was to get a few days off without being looked at as a lazy person by your colleagues and bosses. Depends on the field and maybe State too, I guess."

There is also the matter of RESTING.....and relaxing, and enjoying the place you are in.  Rushing from one thing to another,  doesn't sound very relaxing.  It sounds hectic and rushed.   I've taken several cruises as well........trips around the Med.........everyone says,  ""Oh, how relaxing!""-.......  Hell NO they are not!   a different port every day........limited time in port.... buffets  are like war zones, ......rushing back to the ship before it has to leave......rushing to dinner......then  rushing to the after dinner show.........it's  a solid week of rushing around like a mad dog.  You leave the ship utterly exhausted.  What is the point of trying to see Barcelona, with only maybe 5 or 6 hours ashore. ?  By the time you get anywhere,  it's time to head back.  Then rinse and repeat the next port.  It's like.....yeah, there's the Sagrada Fam√≠lia----take your picture.......okay, let's go!

If this is what they wanted to see and they are happy and not tired from the trip, be it. They saw lots of things, even if quickly, and maybe in the span of a lifetime they'll come again and spend more time where they felt they wanted to see more. If you need to write several comments, longer and longer, with words in caps lock and endless punctuation, to make someone feel ignorant and bad about a trip they enjoyed, you don't seem like a very happy person.

Roma itself needs 4/5 days to be seen, just to make a basic example. Firenze needs at least one day just to visit Uffizi - by ""visiting"" I mean really seeing and understanding something instead of running through corridors and taking random pictures of the statues."
,comment,Florence; Italy; Lido; Most; Naples; Rome; Salerno; Tours; Vatican,Florence; Italy; Lido; Most; Naples; Rome; Salerno; Tours; Vatican,2024-08-12 13:40:34 UTC,4,"Don't make it a cultural thing. As an Italian, this Italians are better than Americans trend has become old. The Italians I know who go abroad do just the same thing. They go to Japan and visit Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kanazawa, Nara, all the temples they see on a map, in 12 days, including the mandatory cultural appropriation of a dinner in kimonos for the picture. They spend ‚Ç¨3.500 to run around the country jumping from one train to the other and the most famous sushi places. They come back and say Japan is so expensive and so crowded and crammed of tourists.  Or they go to the US and cross the whole country seeing NY, all the canyons and parks, and L.A. in two weeks, and then say L.A. sucks and turns out they only visited the Walk of Fame and the studios. A city that would deserve at least one month to just get the gist of it.  It's quite normal that many people want to see lots of iconic places when traveling to the other side of the world to a new country and only have limited days. Other people prefer to see only a couple places and spend more time walking around. That makes more sense for some people, and less sense for other people. In any case, none of them will actually have experienced a whole big historical town, because 2 or 4 or 5 days don't change the fact you only experience the main places as a tourist.  And it's normal that you feel tourists don't experience the gist of a place when you know the place well as a local. For example I could also argue that the 4 or 5 days for Rome you mention are steel very few, and it's a shame to spend a full day in Uffizi or any museum instead of walking through town and the different neighborhoods. The important thing is that once back home, you're happy and not more tired than when you left.  OP seems happy and many people want to do similar trips, wherever they come from. I don't see why argue about someone's personal plan, especially in this arrogant and belittling tone, instead of maybe suggesting to come back and spend more time in town X next time because there's so much to see.   For US people it's also very hard to get a holiday and Italy is not the only country in the world, so it makes sense they don't want to see just one town while here, not knowing if and when they'll come back."

My wife and I once went to a ‚Äúworkers restaurant‚Äù with all courses being meat (3 courses including wine and water for 15 Euro) and after some disbelief (‚Äúyou don‚Äôt eat meat?‚Äù) they prepared a very nice vegetarian option for us. 2) it is quite common to order ‚Äúcontorni‚Äù, side dishes next to your pasta or meat/fish dish. these are mostly vegetables, often very very tasty.

That's most definitely not true, since you can find more traditional vegetarian options in one single region of Italy that in some whole countries outside of it.  You have parmigiana that in general is vegetarian (even if grandmas tend to put prosciutto in it), in Rome the cacio e pepe is a vegetarian traditional dish, along with the traditional suppli, or roman style pizza. In Naples pasta provola e patate is vegetarian too, and I could go on for as long as you want.  Really Italy is one of the best place for vegetarian, good luck eating vegetarian anywhere around Italy, particularly to the north and East. If not for specific restaurants of course."

Moreover there are the Roman style gnocchi, which is also vegetarian dish; pasta alla puttanesca (not strictly roman but well adopted in roman cousine); the fried vegetables, common in all central Italy...

Where was your origin of flight? You know flying through Norse Atlantic Airways could save you a crazy amount of money next time when you fly to Europe. I‚Äôm based in NYC and I found flying to London can be just about $200 one way. Then your connection from London to any other European countries will be much cheaper when using EasyJet and some other budget airlines. I always do this to save money.

Mmmh can i be skeptical about this? I mean I get it was, but did you put any effort in researching for proper restaurants? And for traditional food also?  Italy is really one of the best countries for vegetarians, offerening a great number of traditional vegetarian dishes. In Florence there is the pappa al pomodoro, ribollita, panzanella (ok it is maybe more a starter than a meal), farinata/cecina (a sort of focaccia made of chickpeas), and pici with aglione (or really any other vegetarian version like plain tomato sauce). And this is just traditional food in one city on top of all the basic pizza and pasta you end up eating. And in Rome and Naples there are arguing even more veg dishes.  And then there are also specific vegetarian/vegan restaurants where you can find whatever you like in veg style...  So don't know, I'm sorry you ended up eating just pizza and pasta, there was SO much more than that try it is a shame you stick to few dishes."

My experience: You can often save money on tickets for musea.  Most websites offering tickets are not the official websites (even though they are pretending to) and in fact they are just reselling you official tickets a lot more expensive without offering additional services.   Unfortunately the Italian websites are often difficult to find. Many musea use this one:  https://www.museiitaliani.it/en[https://www.museiitaliani.it/en](https://www.museiitaliani.it/en)  Source: we just spent 2 weeks camping in Italy. I can highly recommend the Umbria region if you prefer less tourism and a slower pace. Spectacular cities such as Perugia, Spoleto, Orvieto, Gubbio, Assisi and many other smaller. (We are from Belgium, Europe, and have visited Italy on previous occasions as well)"
